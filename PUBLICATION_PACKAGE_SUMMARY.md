## Quick Start for Claude Code

### Prompt for Claude Code (Copy & Paste)

```
I need you to run the publication analysis scripts for the IFT/BBSome interactome project.

Please follow these steps:

1. Read the instructions in: analysis/README_FOR_CLAUDE_CODE.md

2. Set the database environment variable:
   export POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_ao9EVm2UnCXw@ep-empty-brook-agstlbfq-pooler.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb"

3. Run all Phase 1 and Phase 2 scripts in order:
   - Script 1: node analysis/scripts/01_dataset_statistics.mjs
   - Script 2: python analysis/scripts/02_network_topology.py
   - Script 3: python analysis/scripts/04_biogrid_comparison.py
   - Script 4: python analysis/scripts/05_string_comparison.py

4. After each script completes:
   - Show me the key statistics from the output
   - Verify all expected output files were created
   - Report any errors

5. When all scripts are complete:
   - Summarize the key findings
   - List all output files created
   - Tell me what numbers to update in manuscript/results_draft.md

If you encounter any errors (missing dependencies, download failures), follow the troubleshooting steps in the README.

Start with Script 1 (dataset statistics).
```

## What Claude Code Will Do

### Phase 1: Dataset Characterization (~1 minute)

**Script 1** will generate:
- Summary statistics (512 interactions, 371 proteins)
- Confidence distribution (High/Medium/Low breakdown)
- Per-bait interaction counts
- Supplementary Tables S1 & S2 (CSV exports)

**Script 2** will calculate:
- Network topology metrics (density, clustering)
- Hub proteins (top 20 by degree)
- Network file for Cytoscape visualization

### Phase 2: Database Validation (~10-15 minutes)

**Script 3** (BioGRID) will:
- Download BioGRID human interactions (~50 MB)
- Match predictions against experimental data
- Calculate validation rates by confidence
- Identify validated vs novel predictions

**Script 4** (STRING) will:
- Download STRING database (~500 MB)
- Compare predictions against STRING scores
- Calculate correlation with ipSAE scores
- Export data for correlation plots

---

## Using the Results

### 1. Update the Manuscript

Open `manuscript/results_draft.md` and replace placeholders:

**Before**:
```
Of our 512 predicted interactions, XX (XX%) were independently validated
by experimental evidence in BioGRID
```

**After** (example with real numbers):
```
Of our 512 predicted interactions, 147 (28.7%) were independently validated
by experimental evidence in BioGRID
```

**Claude Code will tell you all the numbers to fill in.**

### 2. Create Publication Figures

Use the exported data files:

**Figure 1**: Dataset Overview
- Panel C: Plot `confidence_distribution.csv` as histogram

**Figure 2**: Validation
- Panel A: Use `venn_diagram_biogrid.json` for Venn diagram
- Panel B: Use validation rates from `biogrid_comparison.json`
- Panel D: Plot `string_score_correlation.csv` as scatter plot

**Figure 4**: Network Topology
- Import `network_data.graphml` into Cytoscape
- Use `hub_proteins.csv` for hub analysis

### 3. Supplementary Tables (Ready to Use)

These CSV files are publication-ready:
- **Table S1**: `supplementary_table_S1_all_interactions.csv`
- **Table S2**: `supplementary_table_S2_proteins.csv`
- **Table S3**: `biogrid_validated_interactions.csv`
- **Table S4**: `biogrid_novel_predictions.csv`

## Key Metrics to Watch For

### Good Publication-Quality Results

✅ **Validation Rate**: 20-40% in BioGRID (typical for AF3)
✅ **Confidence Correlation**: High > Medium > Low validation rates
✅ **STRING Coverage**: 30-60%
✅ **High Confidence**: At least 30% of predictions (ipSAE > 0.7)
✅ **Novel Predictions**: At least 100-200 not in BioGRID

### Red Flags

❌ Very low validation (<10%) → May indicate scoring issues
❌ No confidence correlation → Check ipSAE calculation
❌ Very few high-confidence predictions → May need different thresholds

---

## Next Steps After Scripts Complete

1. **Review the Results**
   - Check validation rates meet expectations
   - Identify interesting novel predictions
   - Review hub proteins for biological sense

2. **Update Manuscript**
   - Fill in all numbers in `manuscript/results_draft.md`
   - Add specific protein examples from novel predictions
   - Refine interpretation based on actual results

3. **Create Figures**
   - Use provided data files
   - Software: R/Python (plots), Cytoscape (networks), Illustrator (assembly)

4. **Phase 3 Analysis** (Optional, requires new scripts)
   - GO enrichment analysis
   - Pathway analysis
   - Disease association mining
   - Literature validation

5. **Experimental Validation** (Wet Lab)
   - Prioritize top 10-20 novel predictions
   - Co-IP or Y2H experiments
   - Strengthen paper with experimental evidence

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Today (Computational Analysis)**:
- Scripts: ~15 minutes total
- Review results: ~30 minutes
- Update manuscript: ~1-2 hours
- Create basic figures: ~2-4 hours

**This Week**:
- Refine manuscript text
- Create publication-quality figures
- Identify validation targets

**Weeks 2-4**:
- Run Phase 3 analyses (functional enrichment)
- Literature review for Discussion
- Experimental validation (if pursuing)

**Weeks 4-8**:
- Complete manuscript draft
- Internal review
- Submission preparation

## Questions or Problems?

**If scripts fail**:
1. Check `analysis/README_FOR_CLAUDE_CODE.md` → Troubleshooting section
2. Ensure POSTGRES_URL is set correctly
3. Check internet connection (for BioGRID/STRING downloads)
4. Verify Python/Node.js dependencies installed

**If results look strange**:
1. Check `dataset_overview.txt` for basic sanity checks
2. Verify interaction counts match database (512 total)
3. Compare with expected ranges in README

**If you need help**:
1. Share the JSON summary files with me
2. I can interpret results and suggest next steps

Everything is prepared for Claude Code to execute. Just copy the prompt above and let Claude Code run the analysis.

**Total time**: ~15 minutes for all scripts + ~2 hours to review and update manuscript

**End result**: Publication-ready Results section with validated statistics and supplementary tables
