#### 2. **"Mapping the NPHP-JBTS-MKS protein network reveals ciliopathy disease genes and pathways" (Sang et al., *Cell*, 2011)**
This study employed the Localization and Affinity Purification (LAP) method to investigate the functional modules of proteins associated with nephronophthisis (NPH), Joubert syndrome (JBTS), and Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS). They used nine bait proteins in three different ciliated cell lines.

#### 3. **"A dynamic protein interaction landscape of the human centrosome-cilium interface" (Gupta et al., *Cell*, 2015)**
This research utilized BioID to map the proximity proteomes of 56 proteins located at the centrosome-cilium complex, revealing extensive networks and the central role of centriolar satellites in primary cilia assembly.

#### 4. **"Proteomics of primary cilia by proximity labeling" (Mick et al., *Dev. Cell*, 2015)**
This was one of the first studies to apply APEX-based proximity labeling to the proteome of primary cilia in mIMCD3 kidney epithelial cells.

*   **Dataset Location:** The proteomic data, including identified proteins in primary cilia, is detailed in **Table S1**. This table also includes data from a BBS model cell line.

#### 5. **"The ciliary membrane-associated proteome reveals actin-binding proteins as key components of cilia" (Kohli et al., *EMBO Rep.*, 2017)**
Also using APEX-based proximity labeling in mIMCD3 cells, this study provided another view of the ciliary proteome, highlighting the role of actin regulators.

*   **Dataset Location:** The full proteomic dataset is provided as a downloadable Excel file in the **"Expanded View"** section of the article, specifically in **Dataset EV1**.
