1. PROTEIN STRUCTURE AND DOMAINS
================================================================================

SRSF7 is a member of the serine/arginine (SR)-rich family of pre-mRNA splicing
factors that constitute part of the spliceosome. The protein has a modular
domain architecture consisting of:

RNA Recognition Motif (RRM):
- N-terminal RNA recognition motif for binding RNA sequences
- Contributes to RNA binding specificity
- Located at amino acid positions ~1-90

CCHC-Type Zinc Knuckle Domain:
- UNIQUE FEATURE: SRSF7 is the ONLY SR protein family member to encode a
  CCHC-type zinc finger/knuckle domain
- Consensus sequence: C-X[2]-C-X[4]-H-X[4]-C (where X = any amino acid,
  C = cysteine, H = histidine)
- Located between RRM and RS domains
- Provides additional RNA-binding specificity to the RRM domain
- Also known as ZCCHC20 due to this zinc knuckle motif
- The zinc knuckle contributes to the specificity of SRSF7's RNA binding,
  distinguishing it from other SR proteins

RS Domain (Arginine/Serine-Rich Domain):
- C-terminal domain rich in alternating arginine (R) and serine (S) dipeptides
- Facilitates protein-protein interactions between different SR splicing factors
- Critical for spliceosome assembly and protein recruitment
- Subject to extensive phosphorylation (see Post-Translational Modifications)
- Required for nuclear speckle localization
- Contains multiple RS/SR dipeptide repeats

================================================================================
2. PRIMARY SPLICING FUNCTION
================================================================================

CANONICAL SPLICING ROLE:

SRSF7 is a canonical SR protein that plays key roles in constitutive and
alternative pre-mRNA splicing. SR proteins:
- Are essential components of the spliceosome
- Bind to exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) and intronic splicing enhancers (ISE)
- Recruit U1 snRNP (via U1-70K protein) to 5' splice sites
- Recruit U2AF to 3' splice sites
- Facilitate exon definition and splice site recognition
- In eukaryotes, spliceosome assembly starts with interaction between
  U1-70K and SR proteins

SPLICEOSOMAL INTERACTIONS:

SRSF7 interacts with multiple spliceosomal components:
- U2AF65 (U2 auxiliary factor)
- U1-70K/U170K (U1 snRNP 70K protein)
- PRPF8 (pre-mRNA processing factor 8)

Domain-specific interactions:
- The RS domain is particularly important for optimal spliceosome recruitment
- Spliceosomal factors interact less with SRSF7_RRM-GFP (lacking RS domain)
  than with full-length SRSF7-GFP
- Phosphorylated SRSF7 RS domain interacts with U1-70K BAD1 domain
- SRSF7 RRM interacts with U1-70K RRM
- The RS/BAD1 interaction plays a dominant role, while RRM interactions
  enhance complex stability

AUTOREGULATION MECHANISM:

SRSF7 maintains homeostasis through negative feedback:
- SRSF7 binding to its own pre-mRNA promotes inclusion of a poison cassette exon
- The poison exon contains premature termination codons
- This triggers nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of SRSF7 transcript
- Prevents overaccumulation of SRSF7 protein
- Also involves expression of split-ORFs and nuclear body assembly

3. SPECIFIC RNA TARGETS AND SPLICING EVENTS
================================================================================

FAS/CD95 EXON 6 (APOPTOSIS REGULATION):

Function:
- FAS exon 6 encodes a transmembrane domain
- Exon 6 INCLUSION → membrane-bound Fas receptor → promotes apoptosis
- Exon 6 SKIPPING → soluble Fas isoform → inhibits apoptosis (acts as decoy)

SRSF7's role:
- SRSF7 promotes FAS exon 6 SKIPPING (anti-apoptotic effect)
- Upregulation of SRSF7 in BEAS-2B cells → increased exon 6 skipping
- SRSF7 knockdown in A549 cells → increased exon 6 inclusion → apoptosis
- This is a key mechanism by which SRSF7 promotes cancer cell survival

  in colon and lung cancer
- PMC: PMC5844074

MAPT/TAU EXON 10 (TAUOPATHY REGULATION):

Function:
- Tau exon 10 encodes the fourth microtubule-binding repeat
- Exon 10 INCLUSION → 4R-tau (4 microtubule-binding repeats)
- Exon 10 SKIPPING → 3R-tau (3 microtubule-binding repeats)
- Normal adult human brain: ~equal 3R-tau and 4R-tau levels
- Imbalanced 3R/4R ratio → various tauopathies (Alzheimer's, PSP, FTDP-17)

SRSF7's role:
- SRSF7 (9G8) REPRESSES tau exon 10 inclusion → promotes 3R-tau
- Works together with CLK2, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and NIPP1
- SRSF7 also reduces abundance of circular MAPT RNA
- Other SR proteins (SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF6, SRSF9) promote exon 10 inclusion
- Silent/intronic mutations that disrupt exon 10 splicing alone are sufficient
  to cause neurodegeneration and dementia (FTDP-17)

Clinical significance:
- Understanding MAPT splicing regulation is important for Alzheimer's disease (AD),
  progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and frontotemporal dementia
- Altered 3R-tau/4R-tau ratios accumulate in pathologic inclusions in these diseases

PKM (PYRUVATE KINASE M) ALTERNATIVE SPLICING (GLYCOLYSIS REGULATION):

Function:
- PKM gene contains mutually exclusive exons 9 and 10
- Exon 9 inclusion → PKM1 isoform (constitutively active)
- Exon 10 inclusion → PKM2 isoform (regulatable, lower activity)
- PKM2 is the M2 splice isoform normally embryonically restricted but
  re-expressed in cancer
- PKM2 is a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) in cancer cells
- Low PKM2 enzymatic activity confers glycolytic phenotype to cancer cells

SRSF7's role:
- SRSF7 promotes PKM exon 10 inclusion → favors PKM2 expression
- SRSF7 promotes exon 2 skipping on PKM pre-mRNA
- SRSF7 downregulation → upregulates PKM1, inhibits PKM2
- SRSF7 is involved in reprogramming glucose metabolism through PKM splicing

Functional effects:
- SRSF7 knockdown in HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells:
  * Inhibited proliferation, clonogenicity, and invasion
  * Enhanced apoptosis
  * Decreased glucose uptake and lactate production
  * Reduced GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) expression
  * Reduced LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A) expression

Clinical relevance:
- PKM2 is critical glycolytic enzyme in oncogenic mTOR-induced Warburg effect
- Targeting SRSF7-PKM axis may be therapeutic strategy for cancers

- SRSF7 knockdown in human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) → cellular senescence
- Accompanied by p53 protein stabilization
- Generates MDM2 alternative splicing variants, particularly MDM2-C
- MDM2-C identified as key functional variant generated by SRSF7 depletion
- TP53 mRNA levels remain unchanged, but p53 protein increases (increased
  protein stability)
- p21 protein expression also increases

================================================================================
4. NON-CANONICAL FUNCTIONS (BEYOND SPLICING)
================================================================================

In addition to their critical roles in mRNA splicing, SR proteins including
SRSF7 have been shown to participate in:
- mRNA nuclear export
- mRNA translation
- Alternative polyadenylation
- Transcriptional activation (newly discovered for SRSF7)

mRNA NUCLEAR EXPORT:

SRSF7 functions as an export adapter linking RNA processing to nuclear export:

Mechanism:
- SRSF7 binds directly to NXF1 (nuclear RNA export factor 1) in its
  HYPOPHOSPHORYLATED state
- SRSF7 binds mRNA, which is then transferred to the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer
- Enhances NXF1-NXT1 RNA-binding activity
- This coupling occurs after splicing is completed (requires dephosphorylation)
- Works via the TREX/TAP export pathway

Specific targets:
- Histone H2A mRNA export: SRSF3 and SRSF7 are required for export of transcripts
  containing export elements from histone H2A coding region
- Intronless transcripts: Particularly important for replication-dependent histone
  mRNAs that lack introns and are not spliced or polyadenylated
- Histone H2A mRNA contains 22-nucleotide Intronless Transport Element (ITE)
- SRSF7 (9G8) and SRSF3 (SRp20) recognize ITE motif, bind it, and recruit
  TAP/NXF1 to promote export

Long non-coding RNAs:
- SRSF7 and SRSF1 recruited to intronless lncRNA NKILA in sequence-dependent manner
- Promotes nuclear export via TREX/TAP pathway
- SRSF7 depletion → blockage of nuclear export in 80% of cells

  lncRNA NKILA

  splicing factors

ALTERNATIVE POLYADENYLATION:

SRSF7 regulates 3'UTR length through modulation of polyadenylation site usage:

Mechanism:
- SRSF7 binds UPSTREAM of proximal polyadenylation sites (pPAS)
- Enhances pPAS usage in concentration-dependent manner
- This is SPLICING-INDEPENDENT
- Recruits cleavage factor FIP1 to promote proximal cleavage
- SRSF7 interacts with FIP1 via its HYPOPHOSPHORYLATED RS domain
- The interaction is RNA-independent and does not require CFIm or bound RNA

Effect:
- Generates transcripts with SHORT 3'UTRs
- Affects cytoplasmic abundance of transcripts with alternative 3' ends
- Couples alternative polyadenylation to NXF1-mediated mRNA export
- Binding to CFIm requires RNA-binding domain and RS domain hyperphosphorylation

Contrast with SRSF3:
- SRSF3 suppresses pPAS usage (opposite effect)
- SRSF3 and SRSF7 also regulate CFIm (cleavage factor Im) levels

- PMID: 33597006 (Genome Biol. 2021) - SRSF3 and SRSF7 modulate 3'UTR length
  through polyadenylation site regulation
- ResearchGate Figure: SRSF7 interacts RNA-independently with FIP1 via
  hypophosphorylated RS domain

mRNA TRANSLATION:

Evidence for translational role:
- In the cytoplasm, SRSF7 associates with ribosomal subunits, monosomes, and
  (to lesser extent) polysomes
- Suggests role in mRNA translation regulation
- Related SR protein SRSF1 has documented translational functions
- SRSF1's cytoplasmic localization affects translation of ciliary mRNAs

TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION (NOVEL DISCOVERY - 2024):

Major recent finding: SRSF7 drives transcription of IRF7 to promote antiviral
immunity

IRF7 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 7) activation:
- SRSF7 directly activates transcription (NOT splicing) of Irf7 gene
- Occurs at the Irf7 promoter
- SRSF7 maximizes STAT1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1)
  transcription factor binding
- SRSF7 recruits STAT1 to the Irf7 promoter
- Enables pSer2 RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation

Mechanism - cooperation with histone methyltransferase:
- SRSF7 cooperates with KMT5a (SET8, also called SETD8)
- KMT5a is an H4K20me1 (histone H4 lysine 20 monomethylation) methyltransferase
- Together they activate Irf7 transcription

Antiviral immunity:
- Type I interferon (IFN) response activated by IRF3 and IRF7
- Responds to: LPS/Salmonella infection, cytosolic dsDNA, cytosolic dsRNA
- SRSF7 required for optimal expression of cohort of interferon-stimulated genes
  in macrophages
- SRSF7 orchestrates macrophage innate immune gene expression
- Dictates infection outcomes

Significance:
- This reveals unexpected mechanism by which SR proteins can regulate innate
  immune responses
- Goes beyond canonical splicing role
- Opens new avenue for understanding SR protein multifunctionality

m6A METHYLATION REGULATION (EPITRANSCRIPTOMICS):

SRSF7 facilitates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification:

Mechanism in glioblastoma:
- SRSF7 specifically facilitates m6A methylation NEAR its binding sites
- Recruits METTL3 (methyltransferase like 3) to RNA
- SRSF7 interacts with METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP (m6A writer complex components)
- This interaction is RNA-INDEPENDENT (occurs with RNase treatment)
- SRSF7 acts as bridge between RNA binding and methyltransferase recruitment

Functional effects:
- m6A methylation upregulates proliferation and migration of glioma cells
- SRSF7 gene expression positively correlated with glioblastoma (GBM)
  cell-specific m6A methylation
- SRSF7 is novel m6A regulator facilitating methylation on mRNAs involved in
  cell proliferation and migration
- SRSF7 promotes GBM cell proliferation/migration largely dependent on m6A
  methyltransferase presence

5. POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS (PTMs)
================================================================================

PHOSPHORYLATION (PRIMARY REGULATORY MODIFICATION):

Location and kinases:
- Occurs predominantly within the C-terminal RS domain
- Catalyzed by two families of protein kinases:
  1. SR-specific protein kinases (SRPKs) - SRPK1, SRPK2
  2. Cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) - CLK1, CLK2, CLK3, CLK4
- Multiple serine residues in RS dipeptides are phosphorylation targets
- Creates "RS dipeptide phosphorylation"

Functions of phosphorylation:

1. Subcellular localization:
   - Hyperphosphorylation required for nuclear speckle localization
   - Regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling
   - Nuclear import/export balance controlled by phosphorylation state

2. Protein-protein interactions:
   - Phosphorylation state determines which proteins SRSF7 binds
   - HYPOPHOSPHORYLATED SRSF7 RS domain:

     * Binds to FIP1 for polyadenylation
   - HYPERPHOSPHORYLATED SRSF7 RS domain:
     * Binds to CFIm (cleavage factor Im)
     * Interacts with U1-70K BAD1 domain for spliceosome assembly
     * Required for spliceosomal component recruitment

3. Intramolecular vs intermolecular interactions:
   - RS domains can engage in intra- and inter-molecular interactions
   - Hyperphosphorylation switches intramolecular → intermolecular interactions
   - Allows ternary complex formation via both RS domains and RRMs

4. Splicing activity regulation:
   - Phosphorylation state affects splice site selection
   - Modulates spliceosome assembly during early stages
   - The U1-70K and SRSF1 interaction modulated by phosphorylation (applies
     to SR protein family generally)

Temporal regulation:
- Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles coordinate splicing → export transition
- Dephosphorylation occurs after splicing completion
- Allows SR proteins to be recycled for subsequent rounds

Distinct mechanisms:
- Different SR proteins phosphorylated by distinct mechanisms
- Provides specificity and differential regulation across SR protein family

================================================================================
10. CILIARY CONNECTIONS AND POTENTIAL BBS5 INTERACTION SIGNIFICANCE
================================================================================

DIRECT CILIARY ROLE OF SRSF7: NOT ESTABLISHED

Current literature status:
- NO published studies directly linking SRSF7 to cilia or ciliary function
- NO connection between SRSF7 and BBSome reported
- NO association with ciliopathies documented
- NO localization studies showing SRSF7 at ciliary structures

RELATED SR PROTEIN (SRSF1) HAS CILIARY FUNCTIONS:

SRSF1 and cilia:
- Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of SRSF1 required for cilia function
- Cytoplasmic SRSF1 affects mRNA translation
- Contributes to biogenesis and function of motile cilia
- Mutant animals lacking cytoplasmic SRSF1:
  * Multiple traits of dysfunctional motile cilia
  * Defective sperm flagella
  * Reduced translation of ciliary mRNAs in testes
  * Decreased abundance of ciliary proteins

Implications for SRSF7:
- If SRSF1 (related shuttling SR protein) affects ciliary protein translation,
  SRSF7 might too
- Both are "high shuttler" SR proteins with cytoplasmic functions
- SRSF7 also associates with ribosomes and may regulate translation

References:
- PMID: 34338635 (eLife 2021) - Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of SRSF1 required
  for cilia function
- PMC: PMC8352595
- bioRxiv 2020.09.04.263251

SPLICING FACTORS AT THE CILIARY BASE:

General principle:
- Several pre-mRNA processing factors (PRPFs) localize to ciliary base
- PRPF6, PRPF8, PRPF31, SNRNP200
- Implies potential extranuclear functions
- PRPF8 (which interacts with SRSF7) regulates ciliogenesis and regeneration
  from ciliary base

Could SRSF7 also localize to cilia?
- Not yet tested
- Worth investigating given PRPF8 interaction
- May have extranuclear ciliary function

References:
- PMID: 36165912 (Cell Regen. 2022) - Cilia regeneration requires RNA splicing
  factor from ciliary base
- PMC: PMC9525525

ALTERNATIVE SPLICING OF CILIARY GENES:

General importance:
- Alternative splicing regulates many ciliary genes
- Altered splicing observed in genes involved in cilia and centrosomes
- Some anti-proliferative effects mediated by missplicing of ciliary kinases

BBS5 splice variants:
- BBS5 has documented alternative splice variants
- Smaller molecular mass form identified
- Results from cryptic splicing sites in Intron 7
- Truncated BBS5 with unique 24 amino acid C-terminus
- Expression restricted to retina (tissue-specific splicing)
- Could SRSF7 regulate BBS5 splicing? → NOT YET TESTED

References:
- PMID: 26867008 (PLoS One 2016) - Splice variant of BBS5 selectively
  expressed in retina
- PMC: PMC4750968

BBSOME AND CILIARY PROTEIN TRAFFICKING:

BBSome function:
- Complex of 8 proteins (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9, BBS18)
- Regulates protein composition in cilia
- Functions as coat complex for ciliary membrane protein trafficking
- Essential for export of signaling proteins from cilia
- Moves along ciliary axoneme via IFT trains
- BBS5 contains two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and three-helix bundle
- BBS5 required for cone photoreceptor protein trafficking

Why might SRSF7 interact with BBS5?
1. Splicing regulation hypothesis:
   - SRSF7 could regulate alternative splicing of BBS5 mRNA
   - Could control which BBS5 isoform is expressed
   - Could affect BBS5 levels through NMD coupling

2. Non-canonical interaction hypothesis:
   - SRSF7 shuttles to cytoplasm
   - Could interact with BBSome during ciliary protein cargo selection
   - Might link mRNA processing to ciliary protein trafficking
   - Could regulate translation of ciliary mRNAs (similar to SRSF1)

3. Ciliary base localization hypothesis:
   - Splicing factors (PRPF8) localize to ciliary base
   - SRSF7 might also localize to ciliary base
   - Could interact with BBSome during assembly or cargo loading

4. RNA granule hypothesis:
   - SRSF7 associates with mRNAs
   - BBSome might transport RNA-protein complexes
   - Local translation of ciliary proteins near/in cilia

POTENTIAL FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SRSF7-BBS5 INTERACTION:

If validated, SRSF7-BBS5 interaction could mean:

Ciliary transcript regulation:
- SRSF7 might regulate splicing of ciliary protein transcripts
- Could affect 3'UTR length of ciliary mRNAs (via polyadenylation regulation)
- Shorter 3'UTRs → altered stability, localization, translation
- Could affect which ciliary proteins are trafficked

Disease relevance:
- Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) = ciliopathy
- Phenotypes: retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, renal defects,
  intellectual disability
- BBS5 mutations cause BBS
- If SRSF7 regulates BBS5 splicing or function:
  * Could explain some phenotypic variability
  * Might be modifier of BBS severity
  * Could be novel therapeutic target

Retinal specific connection:
- BBS5 splice variants expressed specifically in retina
- Photoreceptor outer segments are specialized cilia
- SRSF7 affects retinal-related proteins (osteopontin in renal cancer)
- Might regulate retinal ciliary protein expression

Metabolic connection:
- SRSF7 regulates glycolysis via PKM splicing
- BBS patients have obesity and metabolic syndrome
- Could SRSF7-BBS5 link metabolism to ciliary signaling?
- BBSome involved in leptin receptor ciliary trafficking (metabolic signaling)

2. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) in cells
3. GST pulldown with recombinant proteins
4. Yeast two-hybrid
5. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for binding kinetics

To determine functional significance:

2. Does SRSF7 affect BBS5 protein levels? → Western blot ± SRSF7 manipulation
3. Does SRSF7 localize to cilia/ciliary base? → Immunofluorescence
4. Does SRSF7 affect ciliary BBSome function? → Ciliary protein trafficking assays
5. Does SRSF7 affect ciliary signaling? → Hedgehog, Wnt pathway assays
6. Does SRSF7 KD cause ciliopathy-like phenotypes? → Cilia length, number, structure

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION FOR ALPHAFOLD3 PREDICTION:

Medium confidence (ipSAE=0.612):
- Suggests possible but not certain interaction
- Could be:
  * True transient interaction
  * Indirect interaction via scaffolding protein
  * Domain similarity leading to prediction
  * Context-dependent interaction (specific cell type/condition)

RS domain interactions:
- SRSF7 RS domain interacts with many proteins
- BBS5 may have RS-like sequences or charged regions
- Could mediate non-specific electrostatic interaction
- Would need validation

RNA-mediated interaction:
- SRSF7 binds RNA
- BBS5 might associate with specific mRNAs
- Could be RNA-dependent interaction
- Test with/without RNase treatment

CONCLUSION ON CILIARY CONNECTION:

Current status:
- NO direct evidence for SRSF7 ciliary role
- NO published SRSF7-BBSome connection
- Related protein SRSF1 IS important for cilia
- Splicing factors CAN localize to ciliary structures

Your AlphaFold3 prediction:
- May represent NOVEL finding
- Medium confidence warrants experimental follow-up
- Could reveal new link between splicing machinery and ciliary function
- Potentially significant for understanding:
  * Ciliopathy mechanisms
  * RNA regulation in ciliary biology
  * BBSome assembly/function
  * BBS phenotypic variability

This would be hypothesis-generating discovery requiring validation.
