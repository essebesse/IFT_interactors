================================================================================
Generated: 2025-11-17
UniProt ID: P61964 (Human WDR5)
Gene: WDR5 (WD repeat domain 5)
Aliases: BIG3, SWD3

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

WDR5 is a highly conserved WD40 repeat protein that functions as a critical
scaffolding component of histone methyltransferase complexes, particularly the
MLL/SET1 family complexes responsible for histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4)
trimethylation. As a core epigenetic regulator, WDR5 plays essential roles in
embryonic development, stem cell maintenance, and gene expression control.
Dysregulation of WDR5 contributes to oncogenesis across multiple cancer types,
making it an emerging therapeutic target. WDR5 interacts with the oncoprotein
MYC to promote tumor maintenance and is essential for HOX gene regulation
during development.

KEY FINDINGS:
- NO ciliary localization or function has been reported for WDR5
- Essential component of MLL/SET1 H3K4 methyltransferase complexes
- Direct interaction with MYC oncoproteins essential for tumorigenesis
- Critical regulator of HOX genes and developmental programs
- Promising therapeutic target with degrader molecules in preclinical testing
- Embryonic lethal when deleted in mice; essential for vertebrate development

================================================================================
1. CILIARY FUNCTION AND TULP3 CONNECTION
================================================================================

STATUS: NO EVIDENCE FOR CILIARY ROLE

After comprehensive literature searches, there is NO evidence that WDR5 has
any ciliary function, localization to cilia, or connection to intraflagellar
transport (IFT) proteins or TULP3.

WDR5 is strictly a nuclear protein involved in chromatin modification and
transcriptional regulation. While TULP3 bridges the IFT-A complex and membrane
phosphoinositides to promote trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors into
primary cilia, WDR5 operates in a completely different cellular compartment
and biological pathway.

The appearance of WDR5 in IFT/BBSome interactor datasets likely represents:
1. A false positive prediction from AlphaFold3 structural modeling
2. A nonspecific interaction not validated experimentally
3. Technical artifact from computational prediction methods

RECOMMENDATION: WDR5-IFT/TULP3 interactions should be considered LOW PRIORITY
for experimental validation unless additional orthogonal evidence emerges.

2. STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY: WD40 REPEAT ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

PROTEIN STRUCTURE

WDR5 is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family, characterized by a
seven-bladed β-propeller fold. Each blade consists of a four-stranded
antiparallel β-sheet forming the canonical WD40 motif. This creates a
symmetrical, circular structure with cavities on opposing faces that serve
as protein-protein interaction platforms.

CRITICAL BINDING SITES

WDR5 contains two major functional interfaces:

1. WBM SITE (WDR5-Binding Motif):
   - Located on one face of the β-propeller
   - Binds RBBP5 in the MLL complex
   - Binds MYC proteins via MYC Box IIIb motif (EEIDVV sequence)
   - Target for MYC-interaction inhibitors

2. WIN SITE (WDR5-Interaction motif):
   - Located on the opposite face of the β-propeller
   - Recognizes arginine-containing WIN motifs (consensus: ARA)
   - Binds MLL1 histone methyltransferase
   - Binds histone H3 tail (specifically H3K4)
   - Target for WIN-site inhibitors

STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS FROM CRYSTAL STRUCTURES

Multiple high-resolution crystal structures have been solved:
- WDR5 alone: PDB 3UR4, 3SMR
- WDR5-MLL complexes
- WDR5-inhibitor complexes
- WDR5-degrader-VHL ternary complex: PDB 7JTP (MS67 PROTAC)

The β-propeller architecture provides a stable scaffold for simultaneous
binding of multiple protein partners, enabling WDR5 to function as a central
hub in multiprotein chromatin-modifying complexes.

================================================================================
3. CHROMATIN REGULATION: HISTONE H3K4 METHYLATION
================================================================================

CORE FUNCTION IN MLL/SET1 COMPLEXES

WDR5 is an essential, non-catalytic component of the MLL/SET (MLL1-4, SETD1A,
SETD1B) family of histone methyltransferase complexes. These complexes
catalyze di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2/me3),
a chromatin mark associated with active transcription.

MECHANISM OF H3K4 METHYLATION

The minimal MLL core complex contains:
- MLL (or SET1): Catalytic SET domain methyltransferase
- WDR5: Scaffolding and histone H3 recognition
- RBBP5: Binds WDR5, enhances activity
- ASH2L: Binds RBBP5, promotes trimethylation
- DPY30: Enhances complex activity

WDR5'S SPECIFIC ROLES:
1. Recognizes dimethylated H3K4 substrates via WIN site
2. Recruits and positions the MLL catalytic domain
3. Stabilizes the complex through RBBP5 interaction via WBM site
4. Enhances processivity of H3K4 trimethylation

CHROMATIN BINDING MECHANISM

WDR5 utilizes a two-step chromatin recruitment mechanism:
1. WIN-site dependent tethering to chromatin-resident proteins containing
   arginine-rich WIN motifs
2. Subsequent recruitment of MLL complex components and transcription factors
   (including MYC) through the WBM site

This dual-interface mechanism enables WDR5 to serve as both a chromatin
reader (recognizing H3K4me2) and a scaffold for complex assembly.

GLOBAL IMPACT ON CHROMATIN

- WDR5 knockdown results in global reduction of H3K4me3 levels
- Affects thousands of gene promoters genome-wide
- Essential for maintaining active chromatin states
- Required for transcriptional memory and epigenetic inheritance

4. PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS AND MOLECULAR COMPLEXES
================================================================================

MLL/SET1 COMPLEX COMPONENTS

Direct WDR5 Interactors in MLL Complexes:
- MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4 (KMT2A-D)
- SETD1A, SETD1B
- RBBP5 (via WBM site)
- ASH2L (indirect, via RBBP5)
- DPY30

MYC FAMILY PROTEINS

WDR5 directly interacts with MYC family oncoproteins:
- c-MYC: Via MYC Box IIIb (amino acids 310-324, EEIDVV motif)
- N-MYC: Conserved Box IIIb interaction
- L-MYC: Conserved interaction

MECHANISM:
MYC proteins bind the WBM site of WDR5 through the conserved EEIDVV sequence
in Box IIIb. This interaction is essential for MYC recruitment to chromatin
and target gene activation.

FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE:
- Structure-guided MYC mutations disrupting WDR5 interaction attenuate MYC
  binding at ~80% of chromosomal locations
- Blocks induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) formation
- Disables MYC-driven tumorigenesis

HISTONE H3 RECOGNITION

WDR5 binds the histone H3 N-terminal tail:
- Recognizes H3K4me2 via WIN site
- Also recognizes H3R2 (arginine 2)
- Binding enhanced by H3K4 dimethylation
- Creates a positive feedback loop for H3K4me3 spreading

NOVEL HISTONE MODIFICATIONS

Recent discovery: WDR5 recognizes histone H3Q5 serotonylation (H3Q5ser), a
non-canonical modification linking neurotransmitter signaling to chromatin
regulation.

- Competition from degrader approaches (see below)

WDR5 DEGRADERS (PROTAC STRATEGY)

PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera) Approach:
Strategy: Bifunctional molecules that recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases to WDR5,
leading to its degradation rather than inhibition.

MS67 - BREAKTHROUGH WDR5 DEGRADER:

- Guides further optimization

Publication:
- PMID: 34586829
- Science Translational Medicine, September 2021
- Jiang et al.

Significance:
MS67 represents a major advance over small molecule inhibitors. By degrading
WDR5 rather than just blocking binding sites, MS67 achieves:
- More complete loss of WDR5 function
- Superior efficacy in preclinical models
- Validation of degrader approach for WDR5

Status: PRECLINICAL
- Not yet in clinical trials
- Strong candidate for clinical development
- Demonstrates proof-of-concept for WDR5 degradation
- May have therapeutic window in MLL-r AML and other cancers

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT STATUS (as of 2025)

NO WDR5-TARGETED DRUGS ARE CURRENTLY IN CLINICAL TRIALS

The field remains in preclinical development stage:
- Multiple academic groups developing inhibitors and degraders
- Pharmaceutical companies exploring WDR5 as target
- MS67 degrader has strongest preclinical data
- Structure-based inhibitors showing improved properties
- AI-driven drug discovery efforts underway (2025)

Barriers to Clinical Translation:
1. Concerns about on-target toxicity (WDR5 essential for development)
2. Need to establish therapeutic window in humans
3. Patient selection strategies (which cancers most vulnerable?)
4. Competition from other epigenetic targets
5. Biomarker development for patient stratification

Most Promising Path Forward:
WDR5 degraders (like MS67) appear more promising than inhibitors due to:

================================================================================

WDR5 IN CANCER: A MULTI-FACETED ONCOGENIC COFACTOR

WDR5 has emerged as a critical node in cancer biology, particularly in
MYC-driven and MLL-rearranged malignancies. Its dual role as both a chromatin
scaffolding protein and a direct MYC cofactor makes it an attractive
therapeutic target.

KEY THERAPEUTIC INSIGHTS:

1. GENETIC VALIDATION:
   - WDR5 loss suppresses tumor growth in multiple models
   - Essential for MLL-r AML and MYC-driven cancers
   - Not simply a passenger in oncogenic complexes

2. DRUGGABILITY:
   - Two targetable surfaces: WIN and WBM sites
   - Crystal structures guide rational drug design
   - Degrader approach (MS67) shows superiority over inhibitors

3. THERAPEUTIC WINDOW:
   - Challenge: WDR5 essential for normal development
   - Opportunity: Cancer cells may be more dependent
   - Strategy: PROTACs may achieve selectivity

4. BIOMARKER POTENTIAL:
   - High WDR5 expression = poor prognosis
   - MLL-rearrangements define sensitive population
   - MYC amplification predicts dependency

5. COMBINATION STRATEGIES:
   - Synergy with chemotherapy
   - Enhance genotoxic drug sensitivity
   - Overcome chemoresistance

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS:

1. Can WDR5 targeting achieve therapeutic window in humans?
2. Which cancer types are most vulnerable?
3. Will degraders be safer than inhibitors?
4. Can normal tissue toxicity be managed?
5. What biomarkers predict response?

CILIARY BIOLOGY CONNECTION: NEGATIVE

Importantly, despite appearing in IFT/BBSome interactor predictions, WDR5
has NO established role in ciliary biology, function, or localization. The
predicted interactions with TULP3 or IFT proteins likely represent:
- Computational false positives from AlphaFold3
- Artifacts from structural prediction algorithms
- Spurious low-confidence predictions

WDR5 remains firmly established as a nuclear chromatin protein with no known
cytoplasmic or ciliary functions.

RECOMMENDATION: Prioritize experimental validation of other IFT/BBSome
interactors with established ciliary or trafficking roles. WDR5-IFT
interactions are LOW PRIORITY unless additional orthogonal evidence emerges.

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

WDR5 is a multifunctional WD40-repeat protein that serves as a critical
scaffolding component of chromatin-modifying complexes. Its essential roles
in histone H3K4 methylation, MYC-mediated transcription, HOX gene regulation,
and embryonic development make it a key player in both normal biology and
disease.

In cancer, WDR5 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target, particularly
in MYC-driven malignancies and MLL-rearranged leukemias. While small molecule
inhibitors have shown modest activity, WDR5 degraders like MS67 represent a
significant advance with robust preclinical efficacy.

Importantly, WDR5 has NO established connection to ciliary biology, IFT
proteins, or TULP3, despite appearing in computational interaction predictions.
This likely represents a false positive from structural modeling approaches.

The field awaits clinical translation of WDR5-targeted therapeutics, with
degrader molecules appearing most promising for achieving therapeutic benefit
in cancer patients.
