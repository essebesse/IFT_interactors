================================================================================
3. CELLULAR LOCALIZATION AND TRAFFICKING
================================================================================

3.1 Subcellular Localization
-----------------------------
SNX10 localizes to multiple cellular compartments:

Primary localization:
- Early endosomes (via PI3P binding)
- Trans-Golgi network
- Centrosome/basal body (during ciliogenesis)
- Base of primary cilia
- Lysosomes (via LAMP1 association)

Cell type-specific localization:
- Osteoclasts: Early endosomes, ruffled border region
- Ciliated cells: Pericentriolar region, ciliary base
- Gastric epithelium: High expression in parietal cells

3.2 Membrane Targeting Mechanism
---------------------------------
SNX10 targets membranes through:

1. PX domain binding to PI3P-enriched endosomal membranes
2. Phosphorylation-regulated membrane association
3. Protein-protein interactions with V-ATPase, FKBP12, and other partners

================================================================================
4. ROLE IN CILIOGENESIS - PRIMARY CILIUM FORMATION
================================================================================

4.1 Discovery of Ciliary Function
----------------------------------
SNX10 was identified as a critical regulator of primary cilium formation in
2011 through systematic screening studies.

Key publication:
PMID: 21844891
Journal: Cell Research, 2011
DOI: 10.1038/cr.2011.134
Title: "A SNX10/V-ATPase pathway regulates ciliogenesis in vitro and in vivo"

4.2 Molecular Mechanism in Ciliogenesis
----------------------------------------
SNX10 regulates ciliogenesis through the following pathway:

1. SNX10 localizes to the centrosome/basal body where ciliogenesis is initiated

2. SNX10 directly interacts with V-ATPase complex subunits:
   - ATP6V1D (V1D subunit)
   - ATP6V0D1 (V0D1 subunit)

3. SNX10 targets V-ATPase to the centrosome (but NOT to the cilium itself)

4. SNX10 and V-ATPase together regulate RAB8A trafficking:
   - RAB8A is a critical small GTPase for ciliary membrane extension
   - SNX10 is essential for trafficking of RAB8A-positive vesicles to ciliary
     membranes
   - Loss of SNX10 prevents RAB8A localization to the cilium base

5. RAB8A-positive vesicles fuse to extend the ciliary membrane

4.3 In Vitro Evidence
---------------------
Cell culture studies demonstrate:
- SNX10 knockdown prevents primary cilium formation in cultured cells
- SNX10 is required for cilium formation in multiple cell types
- Under ciliated conditions, SNX10 is detectable around the base of cilia
- Pericentriolar localization of SNX10 strongly suggests involvement in cilium
  formation

4.4 In Vivo Evidence - Zebrafish Model
---------------------------------------
Zebrafish studies provide compelling in vivo evidence:

- SNX10 is required for ciliogenesis in Kupffer's vesicle (KV)
- KV is the zebrafish left-right organizer analogous to mouse node
- Loss of SNX10 disrupts KV cilia formation
- SNX10 deficiency causes left-right patterning defects of visceral organs
- Demonstrates essential role for SNX10 in embryonic development

PMID: 21844891

4.5 Significance for IFT25 Interaction
---------------------------------------
The interaction between SNX10 (ipSAE = 0.587) and IFT25 is highly relevant
given:

1. SNX10 regulates ciliary trafficking of proteins (RAB8A, V-ATPase)

2. IFT25 forms a heterodimer with IFT27 and is part of IFT complex B

3. IFT25/IFT27 regulate trafficking of BBSome and cargo proteins out of cilia

4. Potential functional connection:
   - SNX10 could regulate endosomal sorting/trafficking of IFT25
   - SNX10 might be involved in IFT protein recycling from cilium to cell body
   - SNX10's endosomal trafficking function could complement IFT25's role in
     ciliary cargo sorting

5. Both proteins are involved in trafficking regulation:
   - SNX10: Endosomal sorting and vesicular trafficking to cilium base
   - IFT25: Intraflagellar transport and BBSome-mediated ciliary exit

This represents a potential mechanistic link between endosomal trafficking
machinery (SNX10) and intraflagellar transport machinery (IFT25).

================================================================================
5. ENDOSOMAL FUNCTION AND VESICULAR TRAFFICKING
================================================================================

5.1 General Endosomal Sorting Function
---------------------------------------
SNX10 is a probable phosphoinositide-binding protein involved in:
- Protein sorting in endosomes
- Membrane trafficking between endosomes and other compartments
- Vesicular transport regulation
- Endosome organization

5.2 Relationship to Retromer Complex
-------------------------------------
While SNX10 is a member of the sorting nexin family, it appears to have
distinct functions from the classical retromer-associated sorting nexins
(SNX1/2, SNX5/6).

Classical retromer structure:
- Cargo recognition complex: VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 trimer
- Membrane deformation: SNX-BAR proteins (SNX1/2 with SNX5/6)

SNX10 distinction:
- NOT a canonical retromer component
- Does NOT contain a BAR domain
- Has unique extended PX (PXe) domain
- Functions independently in specialized trafficking pathways
- Shows unique vacuolation activity not seen in other sorting nexins

Note: Literature searches did not reveal direct interactions between SNX10 and
classical retromer components (VPS26, VPS29, VPS35), suggesting SNX10 operates
in parallel or distinct trafficking pathways.

5.3 V-ATPase Trafficking
------------------------
SNX10's most well-characterized endosomal function is V-ATPase trafficking:

Function: SNX10 is responsible for vesicular sorting of V-ATPase from the Golgi
network and targeting it to specific destinations:
- Centrosome (for ciliogenesis)
- Ruffled border (in osteoclasts)
- Plasma membrane (in gastric parietal cells)

Mechanism: SNX10 interacts with V-ATPase complex and mediates its transport
through the endosomal system to appropriate cellular locations.

Clinical relevance: Mutations in SNX10 cause "secondary V-ATPase deficiency"
where V-ATPase protein is present but mis-localized.

- Essential for acidification

OSTM1 (Osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1):

7. ROLE IN OSTEOCLAST FUNCTION
================================================================================

7.1 Overview of Osteoclast Biology
-----------------------------------
Osteoclasts are specialized multinucleated cells responsible for bone
resorption. Key features:

- Derive from monocyte/macrophage lineage
- Differentiate in response to RANKL and M-CSF
- Form resorption lacunae on bone surface
- Require acidification of resorption compartment
- Essential for bone remodeling and calcium homeostasis

7.2 SNX10's Role in Osteoclast Differentiation
-----------------------------------------------
SNX10 expression is tightly regulated during osteoclastogenesis:

- Strongly upregulated during RANKL-induced differentiation
- Expression increases as monocytes differentiate into osteoclasts
- Required for proper osteoclast maturation
- Regulates NFATc1 nuclear translocation (key transcription factor)

7.3 Ruffled Border Formation
-----------------------------
The ruffled border is a specialized membrane structure essential for bone
resorption:

Structure:
- Highly folded plasma membrane facing bone surface
- Contains high concentrations of V-ATPase
- Creates sealed resorption lacuna beneath osteoclast

SNX10's function:
- Mediates V-ATPase transport to ruffled border
- Essential for ruffled border formation
- SNX10-deficient osteoclasts lack proper ruffled borders
- Required for V-ATPase localization at bone interface

Mechanism:
SNX10 is responsible for:
1. Vesicular sorting of V-ATPase from Golgi
2. Targeting V-ATPase-containing vesicles to ruffled border region
3. Ensuring proper spatial organization of proton pumps

Reference: Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2021
PMID: 34095143
DOI: 10.3389/fcell.2021.671210

7.4 Extracellular Acidification
--------------------------------
Bone resorption requires acidification of the resorption lacuna:

Normal process:
- V-ATPase pumps protons into sealed compartment
- pH drops to ~4.5 in resorption lacuna
- Acid dissolves mineral component of bone (hydroxyapatite)
- Cathepsin K degrades organic matrix (collagen)

SNX10-deficient phenotype:
- Severely defective extracellular acidification
- V-ATPase present but mis-localized
- Failure to acidify resorption lacuna
- No bone resorption despite osteoclast presence

This demonstrates SNX10 is essential for functional acidification machinery,
not just osteoclast formation.

7.5 Endocytosis in Osteoclasts
-------------------------------
SNX10 is critical for endocytic function:

Normal function:
- Osteoclasts internalize degraded bone matrix
- Transcytosis of bone degradation products
- Membrane recycling during resorption

SNX10-deficient phenotype:
- Severely defective endocytosis
- Impaired membrane trafficking
- Accumulated vesicles with abnormal distribution
- Perturbed endosomal pathway

Evidence: Patients' osteoclasts show markedly deranged endosomal pathway

Reference: Scientific Reports, 2017
PMID: 28592808

7.6 Osteoclast Fusion
----------------------
Recent work reveals SNX10's role in regulating osteoclast fusion:

Normal fusion:
- Monocyte precursors fuse to form multinucleated osteoclasts
- Fusion is tightly regulated to produce appropriate cell size
- Proper fusion required for functional bone resorption

SNX10-deficient phenotype:
- Hyper-fusion phenotype
- Mature osteoclasts continue to fuse repeatedly
- Formation of massive, non-functional cells
- Similar phenotype to Ostm1 and Clcn7 deficiency

Mechanism:
SNX10 acts as a downregulator of fusion between mature osteoclasts, preventing
excessive fusion that would impair function

PMID: 34100758
DOI: 10.7554/eLife.65094
Title: "An SNX10-dependent mechanism downregulates fusion between mature
osteoclasts"

7.7 Relationship to RANKL Signaling
------------------------------------
RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κB Ligand) is the master regulator
of osteoclast differentiation:

SNX10 in RANKL pathway:
- SNX10 expression is RANKL-dependent
- Strongly upregulated during RANKL-induced differentiation
- Mediates V-ATPase transport in response to RANKL
- Required for NFATc1 nuclear translocation
- Couples bone resorption machinery to differentiation signals

This positions SNX10 as a critical downstream effector of RANKL signaling.

================================================================================
8. DISEASE: AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE OSTEOPETROSIS (ARO)
================================================================================

8.1 Overview of Osteopetrosis
------------------------------
Osteopetrosis ("marble bone disease") is a group of rare genetic disorders
characterized by:

Pathophysiology:
- Defective osteoclast function
- Impaired bone resorption
- Excessive bone density (osteosclerosis)
- Paradoxically brittle bones despite increased density
- Narrowed bone marrow cavities

Clinical consequences:
- Anemia (reduced bone marrow space)
- Increased fracture risk
- Nerve compression (cranial nerves in skull foramina)
- Visual impairment (optic nerve compression)
- Hearing loss (auditory nerve compression)
- Dental abnormalities
- Failure of tooth eruption

8.2 Genetic Heterogeneity of ARO
---------------------------------
Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis can be caused by mutations in multiple genes:

Major causative genes:
- TCIRG1 (50-60% of cases): V-ATPase a3 subunit
- CLCN7 (10-15% of cases): Chloride channel 7
- OSTM1 (5-10% of cases): CLCN7 β-subunit
- SNX10 (4-5% of cases): Sorting nexin 10
- PLEKHM1 (rare): Vesicular trafficking
- CA2 (rare): Carbonic anhydrase II

Functional classification:
1. Lacunar acidification defects: TCIRG1, CLCN7, OSTM1, CA2
2. Vesicular trafficking defects: SNX10, PLEKHM1

All converge on failure of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

8.3 SNX10-Associated Osteopetrosis
-----------------------------------
Clinical characteristics:

Prevalence:
- Accounts for 4% of ARO cases
- Regional clustering in certain populations (e.g., Northern Sweden)

Age of onset:
- Early infancy to childhood
- Generally classified as "intermediate" severity

Bone manifestations:

- Failure of tooth eruption
- Fracture susceptibility
- Osteomyelitis of jaw (common complication)

Neurological features:
- Optic atrophy (common)
- Visual impairment
- Macrocephaly
- Frontal bossing
- Proptosis (protruding eyes)
- Tonsillar herniation
- Foramen magnum stenosis

Hematological features:
- Anemia (frequent at diagnosis)
- Reduced bone marrow space
- Extramedullary hematopoiesis

Prognosis:
- Variable clinical severity
- Relatively favorable compared to TCIRG1-related cases
- Bone appears to be only affected tissue
- Good response to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)

DOI: 10.1002/jbmr.1824

8.4 Mechanism of Disease
------------------------
SNX10 mutations cause "osteoclast-rich" ARO:

Characteristics:
- Osteoclasts are produced (normal number or increased)
- Osteoclasts are present but inactive
- "Secondary V-ATPase deficiency" - protein present but mis-localized

Cellular defects in SNX10-mutant osteoclasts:
1. Severely defective endocytosis
2. Impaired extracellular acidification
3. Failed ruffled border formation
4. Absent bone resorption activity
5. Perturbed endosomal pathway
6. Abnormal protein distribution

Molecular mechanism:
- V-ATPase fails to reach ruffled border
- No acidification of resorption lacuna
- Inability to dissolve bone mineral
- Non-functional despite normal V-ATPase protein levels

This contrasts with TCIRG1 mutations (absent V-ATPase protein) versus SNX10
mutations (present but mis-localized V-ATPase).

9.1 Global Snx10 Knockout - "Osteopetrorickets"
------------------------------------------------
The global Snx10-deficient mouse has a unique combined phenotype:

Publication: PLOS Genetics, 2015
PMID: 25569234
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005057
Title: "Osteopetrorickets due to Snx10 Deficiency in Mice Results from Both
Failed Osteoclast Activity and Loss of Gastric Acid-Dependent Calcium
Absorption"

Primary findings:

Osteopetrosis component:
- Failed osteoclast activity
- Increased bone density
- Impaired bone resorption
- Non-functional osteoclasts present

Rickets component:
- High stomach pH (hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria)
- Low calcium availability
- Impaired bone mineralization
- Undermineralized bone matrix
- Widened growth plates

Combined phenotype: "Osteopetrorickets"
- Dense but poorly mineralized bone
- Unique dual pathology

Additional features:
- Postnatal growth retardation
- Failure of tooth eruption
- Impaired skeletal development
- Premature death (juvenile lethality)

9.2 Tissue-Specific Expression
-------------------------------
Key finding: Snx10 is NOT osteoclast-specific

High expression tissues:
- Osteoclasts (expected)
- Gastric epithelium (parietal cells) - NEW finding
- Kidney
- Other epithelial tissues

9.3 Osteoclast-Specific Knockout
---------------------------------
To dissect osteoclast versus gastric effects:

Phenotype:
- Severe osteopetrosis (expected)
- NO rickets (key difference from global knockout)
- No gastric acid deficiency
- Normal calcium absorption

Conclusion:
- Osteoclast Snx10 deficiency → osteopetrosis only
- Gastric Snx10 deficiency → achlorhydria → rickets
- Both tissues require Snx10 for V-ATPase function

9.4 Rescue Experiments
----------------------
Dietary calcium supplementation:

Result:
- Rescued global Snx10 knockdown mice from rachitic phenotype
- Prevented juvenile lethality
- Did NOT rescue osteopetrosis
- Demonstrates rickets is secondary to calcium malabsorption

Interpretation:
- Gastric acid required for dietary calcium absorption
- Snx10 required for gastric acid production (V-ATPase trafficking in parietal
  cells)
- Calcium supplementation bypasses gastric acid requirement
- Osteoclast defect remains uncorrected

10. ROLE IN AUTOPHAGY
================================================================================

10.1 Discovery of Autophagy Function
-------------------------------------
SNX10's role in autophagy was discovered through studies in colorectal cancer:

Publication: Autophagy, 2019
PMID: 31208298
DOI: 10.1080/15548627.2019.1632122
Title: "SNX10 (sorting nexin 10) inhibits colorectal cancer initiation and
progression by controlling autophagic degradation of SRC"

Key finding: SNX10 controls SRC oncogene levels through autophagy-mediated
degradation.

10.2 Mechanism - Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion
-----------------------------------------------
SNX10 is required for the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes:

Expression regulation:
- SNX10 is up-regulated during autophagy induction
- Expression increases in response to starvation or stress

Molecular interactions:

With autophagosomes:
- SNX10 binds ATG5 through its C-terminus
- Associates with ATG12-ATG5 conjugate
- ATG12-ATG5 conjugate localizes to autophagosome outer membrane
- SNX10 population associates with autophagosomes

With lysosomes:
- SNX10 associates with LAMP1
- LAMP1 is lysosomal membrane marker
- Another SNX10 population associates with lysosomes

10.3 Working Model for Fusion
------------------------------
SNX10 acts as a molecular tether:

1. One population of SNX10 molecules associates with LAMP1 on lysosomes

2. Another population of SNX10 molecules associates with ATG12-ATG5 conjugate
   on autophagosomes

3. SNX10-SNX10 interactions (homo-oligomerization) bring the two organelles
   into close proximity

4. This proximity facilitates membrane fusion

5. Autophagosome and lysosome fuse to form autolysosome

6. Cargo degradation proceeds

Loss-of-function effects:
- Loss of SNX10 inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion
- Mutation of specific C-terminal residues disrupts ATG5 or LAMP1 binding
- Both scenarios block fusion and impair autophagy

10.4 Substrate: SRC Degradation
--------------------------------
In colorectal cancer context:

SRC kinase:
- Proto-oncogene
- Promotes cell proliferation, survival, migration
- Elevated in many cancers

SNX10 function:
- SNX10 recruits SRC to autophagosomes
- Mediates autophagic degradation of SRC
- Reduces SRC protein levels
- Inhibits tumorigenic signaling

Clinical relevance:
- SNX10 loss → accumulation of SRC → increased tumorigenesis
- SNX10 acts as tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer
- Mechanism: Autophagy-mediated oncogene degradation

10.5 Additional Autophagy Roles
--------------------------------

Publication: bioRxiv, 2024
DOI: 10.1101/2024.05.15.594320

- Similar mechanism to autophagosome-lysosome fusion
- Essential for bacterial killing (Listeria)
- Innate immunity function

10.6 Therapeutic Implications
------------------------------
The autophagy function suggests:

Cancer therapy:
- SNX10 loss may sensitize tumors to autophagy inhibitors
- SNX10 status could be biomarker for treatment selection
- Restoring SNX10 function could suppress oncogene levels

11. IFT25 CONNECTION AND POTENTIAL FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS
================================================================================

11.1 IFT25/IFT27 Complex Overview
----------------------------------

Structure:
- Tight heterodimer with conserved interface
- X-ray crystal structure available
- Both are small proteins (<25 kDa)
- IFT27 is a Rab-like small GTPase
- IFT25 has no obvious catalytic activity

Reference: PLoS One, 2009
PMID: 19399177
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005384

Complex function:
- Component of IFT complex B
- Dispensable for ciliogenesis itself
- Required for BBSome trafficking
- Essential for hedgehog signaling
- Regulates ciliary exit of signaling proteins

11.2 IFT25/IFT27 Role in Ciliary Trafficking
---------------------------------------------

BBSome regulation:
- IFT27 triggers BBSome coat formation inside cilia
- Required for trafficking BBSome and cargo OUT of cilia
- IFT25 and IFT27 both required for BBSome function
- Interact with ARL6/BBS3 (BBSome-associated GTPase)

Reference: Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2018
PMID: 29343560

Regulation of IFT:
- IFT25/IFT27 regulate IFT at flagellar base
- Involved in IFT initiation stage
- Regulatory module distinct from core IFT-B function

11.3 Parallel Functions: SNX10 and IFT25
-----------------------------------------
Both SNX10 and IFT25 are involved in trafficking regulation but in different
cellular compartments and stages:

SNX10 functions:
Location: Endosomes, Golgi, centrosome/basal body
Function: Vesicular trafficking TO cilium base
Cargo: V-ATPase, RAB8A-positive vesicles
Stage: Pre-ciliary, initiation of ciliogenesis
Mechanism: PI3P-dependent endosomal sorting

IFT25 functions:
Location: Within cilium, ciliary base
Function: Intraflagellar transport, ciliary exit
Cargo: BBSome, signaling molecules (Gli2, Patched, Smoothened)
Stage: Post-ciliary formation, ciliary homeostasis
Mechanism: IFT motor-dependent active transport

11.4 Potential Mechanistic Links
---------------------------------
The SNX10-IFT25 interaction (ipSAE = 0.587, medium confidence) suggests
potential functional connections:

Hypothesis 1: IFT Protein Trafficking to Cilium Base
- SNX10 could mediate endosomal trafficking of IFT25 to centrosome/basal body
- IFT proteins must be delivered to ciliary base before entering cilium
- SNX10's endosomal sorting function could supply IFT25 to ciliary entry point
- Similar to SNX10's role in delivering V-ATPase to centrosome

Hypothesis 2: IFT Protein Recycling
- Proteins must be recycled from cilium back to cell body
- IFT trains return from ciliary tip to base
- IFT proteins are removed from ciliary base and recycled
- SNX10 could mediate endosomal sorting of recycled IFT25
- Connects IFT-mediated ciliary exit (IFT25) to endosomal trafficking (SNX10)

Hypothesis 3: Coordinated Regulation of Ciliary Trafficking
- SNX10 regulates trafficking TO cilia (RAB8A vesicles)
- IFT25 regulates trafficking OUT of cilia (BBSome cargo)
- Physical interaction could coordinate bidirectional trafficking
- Ensures balance between ciliary import and export

Hypothesis 4: Signaling Molecule Trafficking
- Both proteins affect signaling molecule localization
- SNX10: Affects RAB8A, V-ATPase (indirectly affects signaling)
- IFT25: Directly affects Gli2, Patched, Smoothened
- Interaction could coordinate signaling molecule availability

11.5 Experimental Predictions
------------------------------
If SNX10-IFT25 interaction is functionally significant, we predict:

1. Co-localization:
   - SNX10 and IFT25 should co-localize at ciliary base/centrosome
   - Particularly during cilium formation or IFT protein delivery

2. Mutual functional dependence:
   - SNX10 knockdown might affect IFT25 localization or levels at ciliary base
   - IFT25 knockdown might affect SNX10's ciliary functions

3. Genetic interaction:
   - Double knockdown should show enhanced ciliary defects
   - May reveal synthetic phenotypes not seen with single knockdowns

4. Trafficking defects:
   - SNX10 deficiency might impair IFT protein delivery to cilium
   - Could manifest as reduced IFT efficiency or ciliary length defects

5. Endosomal markers:
   - IFT25 might transiently localize to SNX10-positive endosomes
   - During trafficking from Golgi/synthesis sites to ciliary base

11.6 Broader Context: Endosomal-Ciliary Trafficking Axis
---------------------------------------------------------
The SNX10-IFT25 interaction represents a potential molecular link between two
major cellular trafficking systems:

Endosomal system (SNX10):
- PI3P-marked early endosomes
- Sorting nexin-mediated cargo sorting
- Vesicular transport to various destinations
- General cellular trafficking

Ciliary system (IFT25):
- Specialized organelle (cilium)
- IFT train-mediated active transport
- Highly regulated cargo selection
- Cilium-specific trafficking

Integration point:
The ciliary base/basal body represents a convergence point where:
- Endosomal vesicles deliver cargo (SNX10-mediated)
- IFT machinery picks up cargo for ciliary entry (IFT25-mediated)
- Physical interaction could facilitate cargo transfer between systems

This type of integration is essential for:
- Ciliary protein homeostasis
- Dynamic regulation of ciliary composition
- Coupling cellular signaling states to ciliary function
- Coordinating ciliary trafficking with cell cycle

11.7 Clinical Relevance
-----------------------
Understanding SNX10-IFT25 interaction could be relevant to:

Ciliopathies:
- Primary ciliary dyskinesia
- Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBSome trafficking defects)
- Other ciliary signaling disorders

Dual-function defects:
- SNX10 mutations: Osteopetrosis + potential unrecognized ciliary defects
- IFT25 mutations: Ciliary defects + potential endosomal trafficking issues

Therapeutic opportunities:
- Targeting SNX10-IFT25 interaction to modulate ciliary function
- Small molecules affecting this interaction could alter ciliary signaling
- Relevant to hedgehog-dependent cancers (medulloblastoma, basal cell
  carcinoma)

19. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

SNX10 (Sorting Nexin 10) is a multifunctional protein with critical roles in:

1. PRIMARY CILIUM FORMATION
   - Essential for ciliogenesis initiation
   - Mediates V-ATPase targeting to centrosome
   - Regulates RAB8A trafficking to ciliary base
   - Required for left-right patterning in development
   - Connects to IFT25 interaction (ipSAE = 0.587)

2. OSTEOCLAST FUNCTION
   - Required for ruffled border formation
   - Mediates V-ATPase trafficking in osteoclasts
   - Essential for bone resorption
   - Regulates osteoclast fusion
   - Mutations cause autosomal recessive osteopetrosis

3. AUTOPHAGY
   - Mediates autophagosome-lysosome fusion
   - Binds ATG5 and LAMP1
   - Controls SRC degradation (tumor suppressor)
   - Involved in mitophagy and phagosome maturation

4. ENDOSOMAL TRAFFICKING
   - PI3P-binding via PX domain
   - Localizes to early endosomes
   - Vesicular transport regulation
   - Cargo sorting and targeting

5. GASTRIC ACID PRODUCTION
   - Expressed in gastric parietal cells
   - Required for V-ATPase trafficking to apical membrane
   - Knockout causes achlorhydria and rickets
   - Essential for calcium absorption

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS:
- Extended PX (PXe) domain binds PI3P on endosomes
- Direct interactions with V-ATPase, FKBP12, ATG5, LAMP1
- Potential interaction with IFT25 (medium confidence)
- Acts as molecular tether for organelle fusion
- Regulates vesicular trafficking to multiple destinations

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
- 4% of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis cases
- Variable clinical severity
- Favorable response to HSCT
- Tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer
- Potential target in ciliopathies

IFT25 CONNECTION:
The predicted interaction between SNX10 (endosomal trafficking) and IFT25
(intraflagellar transport) represents a potential molecular link between:
- Endosomal cargo sorting and delivery to cilium base
- IFT-mediated transport within cilium
- Possible IFT protein recycling pathway
- Coordination of ciliary protein homeostasis

This interaction warrants further investigation to understand how endosomal
and ciliary trafficking systems are integrated at the molecular level.
