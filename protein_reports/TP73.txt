   of airway multiciliogenesis"
   - Genes Dev 30(11):1300-12
   - PMID: 27257214

  multiciliated cell (MCC) differentiation
- Provided long-awaited unifying explanation for diverse p73 knockout
  phenotypes (hydrocephalus, infertility, respiratory disease)
- All phenotypes traceable to defects in motile cilia

MULTICILIOGENESIS REGULATORY NETWORK:

TAp73 Position in Pathway:
GEMC1/MCIDAS + E2F4/E2F5 → TAp73 → FOXJ1, RFX2, RFX3, MYB, miR34bc →
Ciliary structural genes

Upstream Regulators:
- GEMC1 (Geminin coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1)
  * Directly transactivates TAp73
  * Forms trimeric complex with E2F5 and TAp73
  * PMID: 31028178 (2019)

- MCIDAS (Multicilin, Multiciliate differentiation and DNA synthesis
  associated cell cycle protein)
  * Works with GEMC1 to activate TAp73
  * Both are geminin family members

- E2F4/E2F5-DP1
  * Interact with GEMC1 and MCIDAS
  * E2F4 shows high transactivation activity
  * E2F5 enhances GEMC1 activity

Downstream Direct Targets (Confirmed by ChIP-seq and Luciferase):

CELLULAR MECHANISMS:

  * Ciliary motility
- Deficiency causes basal body mislocalization to cytoplasm

MCC Differentiation:
- TAp73 marks multiciliated epithelial cells
- Required for MCC generation in multiple tissues:
  * Respiratory airways (trachea, bronchi)
  * Ependymal cells (brain ventricles)
  * Reproductive tracts (oviduct, efferent ducts)
  * Choroid plexus (together with miR-449)

Cross-Species Conservation:
- TAp73 role conserved across species
- Studied in: Mouse, Xenopus, Zebrafish
- Complete ciliary rescue of knockout MCCs demonstrated
- Confirms TAp73 as conserved central transcriptional integrator

TISSUE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

Respiratory System:

- Controls mucociliary clearance
- Regulates expression of 50+ ciliary genes
- Loss causes chronic respiratory tract infections

Brain/CNS:
- Required for ependymal cilia (limited requirement)
- Partial compensation by miR-449 upregulation
- Choroid plexus development (with miR-449)
- Loss contributes to hydrocephalus

Reproductive System:
- Male: Efferent duct multiciliogenesis
- Female: Oviduct cilia, oocyte quality
- Loss causes infertility in both sexes

- PMID: 31068677
- DOI: 10.1038/s41418-019-0332-7
- PMC: PMC7224178

Findings:
- TAp73 loss reduces miR34bc but INDUCES miR449 cluster
- miR449 compensates in brain (choroid plexus)
- Double knockout (TAp73 + miR449) causes:
  * More severe ciliary defects
  * Pronounced hydrocephalus
  * Brain-specific requirement for both
- Demonstrates complementary regulation in CNS

QUANTITATIVE DATA:
- p73 affects expression of 50 genes for ciliary formation/motility
- 8 of these genes are mutated in human ciliopathies
- About 50% of basal cells express p73
- Mice lacking p73: complete absence of MCCs
- Reduced basal cell numbers in p73 KO
- Number of MCCs severely reduced in TP73 mutant humans

4. CELLULAR LOCALIZATION
================================================================================

PRIMARY LOCALIZATION:
Based on Human Protein Atlas and immunofluorescence studies:

Nuclear:

Centrosome/Basal Body:
- Detected at centrosome structures (Human Protein Atlas)
- Localizes to basal bodies in MCCs
- Required for basal body docking
- Functional role in ciliogenesis

Cytoplasmic:
- Variable depending on cell type and isoform
- Can be aberrant in cancer cells

Plasma Membrane:
- Limited detection (Human Protein Atlas)

ISOFORM-SPECIFIC LOCALIZATION:

TAp73:
Normal Cells:
- Predominantly nuclear in most cell types
- Centrosome/basal body association
- Heterogeneous distribution in some cell lines
- Limited non-random cytoplasmic localization

Cancer Cells (Aberrant):
- Lung cancer (NSCLC): Cytoplasmic sequestration (24/28 cases)
- Pancreatic cancer: Cytoplasmic retention
- Medulloblastoma: Variable nuclear/cytoplasmic

ΔNp73:
- Predominantly nuclear in most tissues
- Strong nuclear localization in lung cancer (35/40 cases)
- Some cases show nuclear + cytoplasmic (8/40)
- Weak cytoplasmic fluorescence in some cell types

FUNCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS:

10. CONNECTION TO IFT PROTEINS AND IFT80
================================================================================

DIRECT CONNECTION: NO EVIDENCE FOUND

Extensive literature searches revealed:
- NO direct physical interaction between TP73 and IFT proteins
- NO ChIP-seq evidence for TAp73 binding to IFT gene promoters
- NO co-immunoprecipitation studies showing interaction
- IFT proteins NOT among the 105 TAp73 ChIP-seq target genes
- IFT80 specifically: No connection to TP73 in literature

INDIRECT FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP:

Different Levels of Ciliary Regulation:

TAp73 (Transcriptional Level):
- Master transcriptional regulator
- Controls MCC DIFFERENTIATION
- Determines: Will a cell become multiciliated?
- Regulates: Basal body docking, axoneme assembly initiation
- Timing: Early in MCC differentiation pathway
- Tissue: Multiciliated epithelia (motile cilia)

IFT Proteins (Post-Transcriptional/Structural Level):
- Intraflagellar Transport machinery
- Controls ciliary ASSEMBLY and MAINTENANCE
- Determines: How is the cilium built and maintained?
- Function: Bidirectional transport along axoneme
- Timing: During and after ciliogenesis
- Tissue: Both motile and primary cilia

POTENTIAL INDIRECT CONNECTIONS:

1. Sequential Pathway Position:
   TAp73 → FOXJ1/RFX2/RFX3 → Ciliary structural genes → IFT proteins function

   - TAp73 may indirectly affect IFT protein expression via downstream TFs
   - FOXJ1 and RFX factors are known to regulate structural ciliary genes
   - Some of those structural genes may include IFT components

2. Shared Ciliary Context:
   - Both important for cilia function
   - TAp73: Required to make the cells that have motile cilia
   - IFT: Required to build and maintain those cilia
   - Complementary but distinct roles

3. Disease Overlap:
   - TAp73 mutations → CILD47 (respiratory disease, PCD-47)
   - IFT80 mutations → Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD),
     short-rib polydactyly III
   - Both cause ciliopathies
   - Different mechanisms, different phenotypes

IFT80 BACKGROUND:

Structure and Function:
- Part of IFT-B complex (IFT-B1 subcomplex)
- Crystal structure: 1.8 Å resolution (Chlamydomonas)
- Two N-terminal β-propellers + C-terminal α-helical extension
- First β-propeller: Tethers to IFT-B via IFT38
- Second β-propeller + C-terminus: Homo-dimerization
- Absolutely required for ciliogenesis (CRISPR KO = no cilia)

Human Disease:
- Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD)
- Short-rib polydactyly type III (SRPIII)
- Abnormal skeletal development
- Partial loss-of-function mutations

IFT-B Complex:
- 15 subunits total
- IFT-B1: IFT88, IFT81, IFT74, IFT70, IFT52, IFT46, IFT38, IFT27, IFT25, IFT22
- IFT-B2: IFT172, IFT80, IFT57, IFT54, IFT20
- Salt-stable biochemical complexes

MECHANISTIC DISTINCTION:

TAp73 Deficiency:
- Reduced number of MCCs generated
- Basal bodies fail to dock
- Axonemes fail to extend
- Problem: Cell fate and early differentiation

IFT Deficiency:
- Normal MCC numbers (potentially)
- Cilia form but are short/defective
- Transport along axoneme impaired
- Problem: Ciliary assembly and maintenance

POTENTIAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. Do any of the 50+ TAp73-regulated ciliary genes include IFT components?
   - Not reported in current literature
   - Could be investigated by detailed gene list analysis

2. Could TAp73 indirectly regulate IFT gene expression via FOXJ1/RFX?
   - Plausible but undemonstrated
   - Would require additional experimental investigation

3. Do TAp73 and IFT proteins cooperate in multiciliated cells?
   - Sequential action likely
   - No evidence of direct cooperation

CONCLUSION ON IFT80 CONNECTION:
NO direct connection between TP73 and IFT80 has been established in the
scientific literature. They operate at different levels of ciliary biology:
- TAp73: Master transcriptional control of MCC fate
- IFT80: Structural component of ciliary assembly machinery

Any connection is INDIRECT via the ciliary context they both support.
