COMPREHENSIVE SCIENTIFIC REPORT: SUFU (Suppressor of Fused)
================================================================================

Interaction Context: ipSAE=0.621 with IFT20 (IFT-B complex)
Report Generated: 2025-11-17

================================================================================
1. PROTEIN OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Gene Name: SUFU (Suppressor of Fused homolog)
UniProt ID: Q9UMX1
Gene ID: 51684
OMIM: 607035
Chromosomal Location: 10q24.32
Protein Length: 484 amino acids (human)
Molecular Weight: ~54 kDa

SUFU is an essential intracellular negative regulator of mammalian Hedgehog
(Hh) signaling that acts by binding and modulating the activity of GLI
transcription factors. While dispensable in Drosophila, SUFU is absolutely
required for mouse embryonic development, highlighting its critical importance
in vertebrate development.

================================================================================
2. KNOWN CILIARY ROLE
================================================================================

2.1 PRIMARY CILIUM LOCALIZATION
--------------------------------
SUFU localizes to the primary cilium, particularly enriched at the distal
ciliary tip in a characteristic "comet tail" pattern. Ciliary localization
of SUFU is:

- Rapid: Strong ciliary accumulation occurs within 30 minutes of Shh stimulation
- GLI-dependent: SUFU ciliary localization depends on ciliary-localized GLI proteins
- PKA-regulated: PKA activation inhibits SUFU ciliary localization
- Dynamic: SUFU translocates to cilia in coordination with GLI2 and GLI3

  "Coordinated translocation of mammalian Gli proteins and suppressor of
   fused to the primary cilium"

2.2 CILIARY TIP COMPARTMENT FUNCTION
------------------------------------
At the ciliary tip, SUFU participates in a KIF7-defined compartment where:

1. SUFU-GLI complexes accumulate at the distal tip
2. Active SMO promotes dissociation of SUFU from GLI
3. Monomeric SUFU and GLI exit the cilium separately
4. Free GLI translocates to the nucleus for transcriptional activation

The ciliary tip represents the critical site where Hedgehog signal transduction
is converted from membrane-proximal events to transcriptional responses.

2.3 CILIA-INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONS
-------------------------------
Importantly, SUFU can also inhibit Hedgehog signaling in the ABSENCE of cilia:

- SUFU interacts with GLI proteins and inhibits GLI activator activity even in
  cells lacking cilia
- This cilia-independent regulation is evolutionarily conserved
- Represents a dual mechanism of Hedgehog pathway control

3. HEDGEHOG PATHWAY: MOLECULAR MECHANISM
================================================================================

3.1 NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF HEDGEHOG SIGNALING
--------------------------------------------
SUFU functions as a tumor suppressor and essential negative regulator through
multiple mechanisms:

A. CYTOPLASMIC SEQUESTRATION
   - SUFU binds GLI proteins in the cytoplasm
   - Blocks nuclear import of GLI proteins
   - Prevents GLI from accessing target gene promoters

   Reference:
   - PMID: 10559945 - Kogerman et al. (1999) Nat Cell Biol 1(5):312-319
     "Mammalian suppressor-of-fused modulates nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling
      of Gli-1"

B. TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION
   - Even in the nucleus, SUFU can repress GLI-mediated transcription
   - Recruits corepressor complexes (SAP18-mSin3, p66β-NuRD)
   - Directly inhibits GLI DNA binding activity

     "Regulation of Sufu activity by p66β and Mycbp provides new insight into
      vertebrate Hedgehog signaling"

C. PROMOTION OF GLI PROCESSING
   - SUFU recruits GSK3β to GLI3
   - Facilitates GLI3 phosphorylation by PKA, CK1, and GSK3β
   - Promotes proteolytic processing of GLI3 into the repressor form (GLI3R)

     "Sufu recruits GSK3beta for efficient processing of Gli3"

3.2 PATHWAY ACTIVATION: RELIEF OF SUFU INHIBITION
-------------------------------------------------
Hedgehog ligand binding triggers a cascade:

1. Hedgehog → Patched (PTCH1) → Smoothened (SMO) activation
2. SMO accumulates in primary cilium
3. SUFU-GLI complexes recruited to ciliary tip
4. Active SMO causes SUFU-GLI dissociation
5. Free GLI exits cilium and enters nucleus
6. Transcriptional activation of Hh target genes

================================================================================
5. CILIARY LOCALIZATION AND DYNAMICS
================================================================================

5.1 LOCALIZATION PATTERN
------------------------
- Primary cilium: Enriched at distal tip ("comet tail" pattern)
- Differential from SMO: SUFU at tip vs SMO along ciliary shaft
- Co-localizes with: GLI2, GLI3, KIF7
- Basal body: Minimal accumulation

5.2 TRAFFICKING DYNAMICS
------------------------
Timeline of SUFU ciliary accumulation:
- 0 min (no Shh): Low/absent from cilia
- 30 min (+Shh): Strong ciliary localization begins
- Sustained: Maintained during active signaling
- Post-activation: SUFU exits cilium after GLI dissociation

Regulation:
- GLI-dependent: Requires GLI proteins for ciliary entry
- SMO-dependent: Active SMO maintains SUFU at cilia
- PKA-inhibited: PKA activation blocks ciliary localization

5.3 CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES
--------------------------
SUFU alternates between "open" and "closed" conformations:

- CLOSED: Stabilized by GLI binding, inhibits signaling
- OPEN: Promoted by GLI dissociation and Hh stimulation
- Transition: Involves 58° rotation of C-terminal domain via flexible linker

   regulation"

================================================================================
6. STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
================================================================================

6.1 PROTEIN ARCHITECTURE
------------------------
SUFU is a two-domain protein:

A. N-TERMINAL DOMAIN (NTD)
   - Contains GLI-binding surface
   - Shows acidic surface patch (Glu106, Asp111, Glu152, Asp159, Glu181,
     Glu221, Asp262)
   - Critical for cytoplasmic retention of GLI
   - SIN (SUFU-interacting site N-terminal) binding region

B. C-TERMINAL DOMAIN (CTD)
   - Second GLI-binding interface
   - SIC (SUFU-interacting site C-terminal) binding region
   - Regulatory subdomain

C. FLEXIBLE LINKER
   - Connects NTD and CTD
   - Allows conformational changes upon GLI binding
   - Enables "open" to "closed" transitions

D. INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED LOOP
   - Crucial for pathway activation
   - May interact with other regulatory proteins

6.2 CRYSTAL STRUCTURES (PDB Entries)
------------------------------------
Multiple high-resolution structures available:

1. PDB: 4BL8
   - Crystal structure of full-length human SUFU
   - Resolution: 2.40 Å
   - "Open" conformation

2. PDB: 4BL9 and 4BLA

4. PDB: 4BLD
   - Crystal structure of human SUFU-GLI3p complex
   - Resolution: 2.85 Å
   - Shows GLI3 peptide binding
   - "Closed" conformation

Key Structural Features:
- GLI peptide lies between β-sheets of SUFU NTD and CTD
- Peptide is "clamped" between the two domains
- 58° rotation of CTD upon GLI binding (open → closed)
- SYGHL motif is highly conserved across GLI1/2/3
- Gly122 and His123 in GLI are crucial for SUFU binding

6.3 BINDING MOTIFS
------------------
GLI proteins contain conserved SUFU-binding elements:

A. SYGHL MOTIF (N-terminal site, SIN)
   - Sequence: Ser-Tyr-Gly-His-Leu
   - Conserved in GLI1, GLI2, GLI3
   - Primary SUFU recognition sequence
   - Gly and His are critical for binding affinity

B. C-TERMINAL SITE (SIC)
   - Second binding interface
   - Contributes to optimal inhibition
   - May have distinct functional role from SIN

Both SIN and SIC are required for maximal SUFU-mediated repression, but
regulate GLI through distinct mechanisms:
- SIN: Primarily mediates cytoplasmic retention
- SIC: Contributes to nuclear inhibition

6.4 POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS
------------------------------------
Key phosphorylation sites:

- Ser-342: GSK3β phosphorylation site
- Ser-346: PKA phosphorylation site
- Dual phosphorylation: Stabilizes SUFU protein

Sequential phosphorylation:
1. PKA phosphorylates Ser-346 first
2. This primes GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-342
3. Dual modification protects SUFU from degradation

Clinical Features (SUFU-specific):
- Multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs)
- Infundibulocystic BCCs (more common in SUFU vs PTCH1 mutations)
- Trichoepitheliomas
- Childhood medulloblastoma (MUCH higher risk than PTCH1)

   nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and multiple hereditary
   infundibulocystic basal cell carcinoma"

7.2 MEDULLOBLASTOMA
-------------------
SUFU mutations strongly predispose to childhood brain tumors:

Key Findings:
- Risk in SUFU mutation carriers: Up to 20× higher than PTCH1 carriers
- Risk in PTCH1 mutation carriers: <2%
- Age at diagnosis: Median 17 months (very early childhood)
- Histological subtypes:
  * Desmoplastic/nodular (most common)
  * Medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN)
  * Classic medulloblastoma

Molecular Mechanism:
- Loss of SUFU removes negative regulation of Hedgehog pathway
- Constitutive GLI activation drives proliferation
- Tumor cells show activated Hh target genes (GLI1, PTCH1, MYCN)

Clinical Implications:
- MRI surveillance recommended for SUFU mutation carriers in early childhood
- NOT recommended for PTCH1 carriers (much lower risk)

7.3 BASAL CELL CARCINOMA (BCC)
------------------------------
SUFU mutations predispose to multiple BCCs:

Specific Features:
- Infundibulocystic subtype more common in SUFU vs PTCH1
- Multiple hereditary infundibulocystic BCC (MHIBCC) phenotype
- Adult onset (middle age) in some families
- May occur without other Gorlin syndrome features

Molecular Basis:
- Loss of SUFU in skin cells
- Aberrant Hh pathway activation
- Uncontrolled proliferation of basal cells

   predisposition syndromes: similar, but not the same"

7.4 JOUBERT SYNDROME (JBTS32)
-----------------------------
Hypomorphic recessive SUFU mutations cause Joubert syndrome with skeletal
features:

Clinical Presentation:
- Congenital ataxia
- Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia
- Elongated superior cerebellar peduncles ("molar tooth sign" on MRI)
- Cranio-facial dysmorphisms:
  * Hypertelorism
  * Depressed nasal bridge
  * Frontal bossing
- Postaxial polydactyly
- Polymicrogyria (in some patients)

Genetic Basis:
- Homozygous missense mutations (e.g., I406T, H176R)
- Hypomorphic (partial loss of function), NOT null mutations
- Identified in consanguineous families

Molecular Mechanism:
- Reduced SUFU protein stability
- Decreased GLI3 binding affinity
- Impaired GLI3 processing to repressor form (GLI3R)
- Deregulated SHH pathway activity
- Altered expression of SHH target genes

This represents a ciliopathy phenotype caused by aberrant Hedgehog signaling.

7.5 CONGENITAL OCULAR MOTOR APRAXIA (COMA)
------------------------------------------
Heterozygous truncating SUFU variants cause isolated COMA:

Clinical Features:
- Congenital onset
- Inability to initiate voluntary horizontal saccades
- Compensatory head thrusts
- No other systemic features

Genetic Basis:
- Heterozygous truncating (loss-of-function) variants
- Both familial and de novo mutations
- 15 individuals identified across multiple families

This represents a neurodevelopmental phenotype distinct from cancer
predisposition.

  DOI: 10.1038/s41436-020-00979-w

7.6 OTHER MALIGNANCIES
----------------------
SUFU mutations may contribute to:
- Familial meningioma
- Colorectal tumors (via SuFu negating protein 1 - SuNP1)
- Other Hedgehog-driven cancers

7.7 GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS
-----------------------------------
Mutation Type vs Phenotype:

1. HETEROZYGOUS LOSS-OF-FUNCTION (Truncating)
   - Gorlin syndrome
   - Medulloblastoma predisposition
   - Basal cell carcinomas
   - Congenital ocular motor apraxia

2. HOMOZYGOUS HYPOMORPHIC (Partial loss-of-function)
   - Joubert syndrome with skeletal features
   - Developmental abnormalities
   - Ciliopathy phenotype

3. COMPLETE LOSS (Homozygous null)
   - Embryonic lethal in mice (E9.5)
   - Not compatible with human life

Phenotypic Variability:
Even within families carrying identical SUFU mutations, clinical presentation
can range from:
- MHIBCC phenotype (skin tumors only)
- Full Gorlin syndrome
- Life-threatening medulloblastoma

This suggests modifier genes and environmental factors influence penetrance.

8.2 HYPOMORPHIC MODELS
----------------------
To overcome early lethality, hypomorphic models were developed:

---------------------------------
- Viable and fertile
- Develop tumors with age (incomplete penetrance)
- Medulloblastoma in some animals
- Loss of wild-type allele in tumors (loss of heterozygosity)
- Models human Gorlin syndrome

8.5 MOUSE VS HUMAN PHENOTYPES
-----------------------------
Key Differences:
- Mouse Sufu-/- is embryonic lethal; human homozygous null likely similar
- Human heterozygous mutations: cancer predisposition, viable
- Human hypomorphic recessive: Joubert syndrome, viable
- Mouse models critical for understanding developmental roles

9. IFT20 CONNECTION AND CILIARY TRAFFICKING
================================================================================

9.1 CONTEXT OF PREDICTED INTERACTION
------------------------------------
Interaction Parameters:
- ipSAE score: 0.621 (medium-high confidence)
- Bait: IFT20 (IFT-B complex component)
- Source: AlphaFold3 prediction

This interaction is biologically plausible given:
1. Both proteins localize to primary cilia
2. Both are essential for Hedgehog signaling
3. Both traffic between cytoplasm and cilium

9.2 IFT20: UNIQUE IFT PROTEIN
-----------------------------
IFT20 is distinctive among IFT proteins:

- Localization: Golgi complex AND cilia (unique)
- Function: Trafficking ciliary membrane proteins from Golgi to basal body
- Complex: IFT-B core (IFT20/52/57/88)
- Role: Anterograde transport, ciliary assembly

IFT20 defects:
- Shorter cilia
- Fewer cilia
- Blocked trafficking from Golgi to cilia
- Impaired Hedgehog signaling

  DOI: 10.1091/mbc.E17-10-0600

9.3 POTENTIAL FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
-------------------------------------
Several models for IFT20-SUFU interaction:

A. SUFU AS IFT CARGO
   Hypothesis: IFT20 may transport SUFU to cilia

   Evidence supporting:
   - SUFU rapidly accumulates at ciliary tip upon Shh stimulation
   - IFT20 traffics membrane and soluble proteins to cilia
   - SUFU ciliary localization is regulated (not constitutive)

   Mechanism:
   - IFT20 at Golgi → binds SUFU
   - IFT20 → basal body → ciliary entry
   - Anterograde IFT delivers SUFU to ciliary tip
   - SUFU released at tip for GLI interaction

B. COORDINATED REGULATION OF HEDGEHOG COMPONENTS
   Hypothesis: IFT20 and SUFU coordinate trafficking of Hh pathway proteins

   Known IFT roles in Hedgehog:
   - IFT25/27: Remove SMO from cilia
   - IFT proteins: Required for GLI2/3 processing
   - IFT-B: Essential for ciliary assembly

   SUFU dependencies:
   - Requires GLI for ciliary localization
   - Requires active SMO for ciliary accumulation
   - May require IFT for ciliary entry/exit

C. REGULATION OF GLI PROCESSING
   Hypothesis: IFT20 facilitates SUFU-mediated GLI processing

   GLI processing requires:
   - Ciliary localization
   - SUFU binding
   - Kinase recruitment (PKA, CK1, GSK3β)
   - Proteasome access

   IFT20 could:
   - Deliver SUFU to ciliary processing sites
   - Coordinate GLI and SUFU co-trafficking
   - Remove processed GLI from cilia

D. QUALITY CONTROL
   Hypothesis: IFT20 removes inactive SUFU from cilia

   After GLI dissociation:
   - Monomeric SUFU exits cilium
   - May require retrograde IFT
   - Recycled for next signaling cycle

9.4 EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS
----------------------------
To test IFT20-SUFU interaction:

1. Co-immunoprecipitation
   - Does endogenous IFT20 pull down SUFU?
   - Is interaction Hedgehog-dependent?
   - Which regions mediate binding?

2. Ciliary trafficking
   - Does IFT20 depletion affect SUFU ciliary localization?
   - Is SUFU ciliary accumulation IFT-dependent?
   - Does SUFU co-migrate with IFT trains?

3. Functional assays
   - Does IFT20 loss affect SUFU-GLI complex formation?
   - Is GLI processing impaired without IFT20?
   - Do IFT20 and SUFU genetically interact?

4. Structural validation
   - Can SUFU-IFT20 complex be reconstituted in vitro?
   - What is the binding interface?
   - Is interaction direct or mediated by other IFT-B components?

9.5 BROADER CONTEXT: IFT AND HEDGEHOG SIGNALING
-----------------------------------------------
IFT machinery is deeply integrated into Hedgehog signaling:

Components Required:
- IFT88: Ciliary assembly, essential for all Hh signaling
- IFT20: Golgi-to-cilium trafficking
- IFT25/27: SMO removal from cilia
- IFT-A: Retrograde transport, GLI processing
- IFT-B: Anterograde transport, ciliary assembly

Loss of IFT typically blocks Hedgehog signaling by:
1. Preventing ciliary assembly
2. Blocking SMO ciliary accumulation
3. Impairing GLI ciliary trafficking
4. Disrupting GLI processing

SUFU can function without cilia (cytoplasmic regulation), but ciliary SUFU
is critical for fine-tuning GLI activation at the ciliary tip.

9.6 COMPARISON WITH OTHER IFT-HH INTERACTIONS
---------------------------------------------
Known IFT-Hedgehog protein interactions:

1. IFT25-IFT27 → SMO
   - Direct regulation of SMO ciliary exit
   - Phosphorylation-dependent

2. IFT-A → GLI processing
   - IFT122, IFT139, IFT140 mutations
   - Impaired GLI3 processing

3. IFT88 → General ciliary assembly
   - Required for all ciliary Hedgehog signaling

IFT20 → SUFU would represent:
- Novel trafficking pathway for Hh regulator
- Mechanism for ciliary tip accumulation
- Integration of IFT-B with negative regulation

================================================================================
11. REGULATION OF SUFU PROTEIN STABILITY
================================================================================

11.1 PHOSPHORYLATION-DEPENDENT STABILIZATION
--------------------------------------------
PKA and GSK3β phosphorylation stabilizes SUFU:

Mechanism:
1. PKA phosphorylates Ser-346
2. This primes GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-342
3. Dual phosphorylation protects SUFU from degradation
4. Hedgehog activation reverses phosphorylation
5. Dephosphorylated SUFU is unstable

Result:
- In absence of Hh signal: SUFU is stable (phosphorylated)
- During Hh activation: SUFU is degraded (dephosphorylated)

Reference:
- PMID: 21317289 - Chen et al. (2011) J Biol Chem 286(16):13502-13511

11.2 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 4 (PP4)
-------------------------------
PP4 dephosphorylates SUFU:

- Removes phosphate from Ser-342/346
- Promotes SUFU degradation
- Enhances Hedgehog signaling
- Acts as positive regulator of pathway

Reference:
- Zhang et al. (2020) Cell Death Dis 11(8):651
  DOI: 10.1038/s41419-020-02843-w

11.3 PROTEASOMAL DEGRADATION
----------------------------
SUFU is subject to ubiquitin-proteasome pathway:

- Degraded during active Hedgehog signaling
- Proteasome inhibition stabilizes SUFU
- Specific E3 ligase not fully characterized

11.4 GLI BINDING PROTECTS SUFU
------------------------------
Paradoxically:
- GLI binding stabilizes SUFU protein
- Prevents degradation
- SUFU-GLI complex more stable than free SUFU

This creates negative feedback: GLI proteins stabilize their own inhibitor.

================================================================================
12. EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION
================================================================================

12.1 CROSS-SPECIES COMPARISON
-----------------------------
SUFU homologs exist across species:

- Drosophila melanogaster: Su(fu)
- Danio rerio (zebrafish): sufu
- Mus musculus (mouse): Sufu
- Homo sapiens (human): SUFU

12.2 FUNCTIONAL CONSERVATION
----------------------------
Drosophila vs Mammals:

- Drosophila: Su(fu) is NOT essential for viability
- Mammals: SUFU is essential (embryonic lethal if null)
- Both: Negative regulator of Hh signaling
- Both: Binds Ci/Gli transcription factors

This suggests mammals evolved greater dependence on SUFU for Hedgehog
regulation.

12.3 STRUCTURAL CONSERVATION
----------------------------
- SYGHL binding motif: Highly conserved in Ci/Gli across species
- Two-domain architecture: Conserved
- N-terminal and C-terminal Gli-binding sites: Conserved

Reference:
- PMID: 26271100 - Humke et al. (2015) Dev Biol 406(2):255-269

   Mammalian Hedgehog Response"

================================================================================
13. SUMMARY: BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
================================================================================

13.1 CENTRAL ROLE IN HEDGEHOG SIGNALING
---------------------------------------
SUFU is the MASTER NEGATIVE REGULATOR of vertebrate Hedgehog signaling:

1. Cytoplasmic Function:
   - Sequesters GLI proteins away from nucleus
   - Prevents transcriptional activation
   - Promotes GLI3 processing to repressor form

2. Nuclear Function:
   - Directly represses GLI-mediated transcription
   - Recruits corepressor complexes
   - Modulates chromatin state at Hh target genes

3. Ciliary Function:
   - Localizes to ciliary tip with GLI
   - Site of signal-dependent SUFU-GLI dissociation
   - Integrates ciliary architecture with signaling output

13.2 DEVELOPMENTAL IMPORTANCE
-----------------------------
SUFU is essential for:
- Embryonic patterning (neural tube, limbs, heart)
- CNS development
- Skeletal development
- Proper Hedgehog gradient formation

Loss of SUFU → embryonic lethality (complete) or severe developmental
defects (hypomorphic)

13.3 DISEASE RELEVANCE
---------------------
SUFU dysfunction causes:
- Childhood cancer (medulloblastoma, BCC)
- Ciliopathies (Joubert syndrome)
- Neurodevelopmental disorders (COMA)
- Tumor predisposition syndromes (Gorlin syndrome)

SUFU is bona fide tumor suppressor with haploinsufficiency.

13.4 THERAPEUTIC IMPORTANCE
---------------------------
SUFU status determines:
- Drug response (SMO inhibitors ineffective if SUFU lost)
- Treatment strategy (need GLI inhibitors for SUFU-deficient tumors)
- Patient surveillance (MRI screening for SUFU mutation carriers)

13.5 IFT20 INTERACTION: POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE
---------------------------------------------
Predicted interaction with IFT20 suggests:

1. SUFU may be IFT cargo for ciliary delivery
2. IFT machinery may regulate SUFU ciliary dynamics
3. Coordination between ciliary transport and Hh signaling
4. Quality control of Hh pathway components

If validated, this would reveal:
- Novel mechanism of SUFU regulation
- Integration of IFT-B complex with Hh pathway
- Potential therapeutic target (disrupting IFT20-SUFU)

================================================================================
15. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

SUFU (Suppressor of Fused) is a master negative regulator of Hedgehog
signaling with essential roles in development, ciliary biology, and tumor
suppression. Its interaction with IFT20 (ipSAE=0.621) represents a
potentially novel mechanism for regulating SUFU ciliary trafficking and
Hedgehog pathway output.

Key Points:
1. SUFU binds and inhibits GLI transcription factors at multiple levels
2. Localizes to ciliary tip where Hh signal transduction occurs
3. Loss causes embryonic lethality (complete) or severe disease (partial)
4. Mutations predispose to childhood cancer and ciliopathies
5. SUFU status determines cancer drug response
6. IFT20 may facilitate SUFU ciliary delivery and/or recycling

Future Directions:
- Validate IFT20-SUFU physical interaction
- Define mechanism of SUFU ciliary trafficking
- Develop therapeutics for SUFU-deficient cancers
- Understand genotype-phenotype correlations
- Exploit SUFU biology for precision medicine

The predicted IFT20-SUFU interaction warrants experimental validation and
could reveal fundamental insights into the coordination of intraflagellar
transport with Hedgehog signal transduction.
