================================================================================
1. SEMINAL FLUID FUNCTION: GEL MATRIX AND COAGULATION
================================================================================

PRIMARY BIOLOGICAL ROLE:
SEMG1 is the predominant protein of human semen and represents the major structural
component of the seminal coagulum (gel matrix). It accounts for 20-40% of total
seminal plasma proteins and is the largest protein component by concentration and
molecular mass in human ejaculate.

COAGULATION MECHANISM:
- Zinc-dependent gel formation: After ejaculation, SEMG1 interacts with zinc ions
  (high concentration in seminal plasma: 140-270 μM) to form a viscous gel matrix
  that encases ejaculated spermatozoa
- Coagulum formation is complete within 5-20 minutes post-ejaculation
- The gel matrix serves multiple protective functions for sperm during the initial
  post-ejaculatory phase
- SEMG1 associates with SEMG2 to form the major structural components of the
  coagulum (two homologous proteins sharing 78% sequence identity)
- Molecular masses: SEMG1 ~50 kDa; SEMG2 ~63 kDa

INITIAL SPERM IMMOBILIZATION:
- SEMG1 directly inhibits sperm motility through multiple mechanisms:
  1) Coating sperm surface and reducing flagellar movement amplitude
  2) Interfering with sperm capacitation by inhibiting reactive oxygen species
     (superoxide anion) generation
  3) Physically trapping sperm within the coagulum matrix
- This immobilization is physiologically important for protecting sperm during
  transit through the female reproductive tract

================================================================================
2. CILIARY ROLE AND SPERM FLAGELLA CONNECTION
================================================================================

SPERM FLAGELLA AND IFT INVOLVEMENT:
Sperm flagella are specialized cilia that require sophisticated intraflagellar
transport (IFT) machinery for their assembly and maintenance. The IFT-A complex,
to which TULP3 binds, is essential for retrograde transport in flagella during
spermatogenesis.

TULP3 AS CARGO ADAPTOR:
- TULP3 is a universal adaptor for membrane-associated cargo trafficking into
  and within cilia/flagella
- TULP3 bridges the IFT-A complex (6 subunits: IFT122, IFT121, IFT140, IFT144,
  IFT139, IFT43) to membrane phosphoinositides
- Functions as a phosphoinositide-dependent cargo capture module for transport
  of diverse integral membrane proteins

CONTEXT FOR SEMG1-TULP3 INTERACTION:
While SEMG1 is not intrinsically a ciliary protein, the predicted interaction
(ipSAE=0.559) suggests potential functional connections in the reproductive
context:

1. Sperm flagella anatomy: Sperm require IFT for axoneme assembly, outer dense
   fiber proteins, and flagellar membrane proteins
2. Reproductive tract environment: SEMG1 is secreted into the female reproductive
   tract where spermatozoa migrate
3. Potential trafficking: SEMG1 may interact with TULP3-mediated cargo or
   modulate flagellar protein transport indirectly
4. Medium confidence (ipSAE 0.559): Suggests interaction occurs but with lower
   geometric complementarity, consistent with transient or regulatory interactions

TULP3 CILIARY FUNCTIONS:
- Transports GPCRs (Sstr3, Mchr1, Npy2r, GPR161) into primary cilia
- Traffics polycystic kidney disease proteins (polycystin 1/2)
- Mediates ARL13B and INPP5E localization to flagella
- Essential for sperm flagella development during spermatogenesis

================================================================================
3. PROTEIN INTERACTIONS AND BINDING PARTNERS
================================================================================

PRIMARY INTERACTION PARTNERS:

A. EPPIN (Epididymal Protease Inhibitor) - MOST CRITICAL:
   - SEMG1 is the major physiological binding partner of EPPIN on spermatozoa
   - Binding site: SEMG1 C-terminus (Cys-239 critical residue)
   - EPPIN binding site: C102-P133 region (Cys102, Tyr107, Phe117 essential)
   - Function: EPPIN-bound SEMG1 inhibits sperm motility and capacitation
   - Evolutionary significance: Adaptive molecular coevolution at innate immunity-
     reproduction interface
   - Contraceptive target: This interaction is being developed as non-hormonal
     male contraceptive (disrupts sperm function)

B. SEMG2 (Semenogelin 2):
   - ~78% sequence identity with SEMG1
   - Co-aggregate with SEMG1 to form coagulum (share gel-forming properties)
   - Cleaved by PSA in parallel with SEMG1 during liquefaction
   - Different interactome: 34 common binding partners, 86 unique to SEMG1,
     only 4 unique to SEMG2

C. SERPINA5 (Protein C Inhibitor):
   - Binds SEMG2 in seminal plasma
   - Regulates proteolytic processing of semenogelins
   - Coordinates semen liquefaction timing

D. FIBRONECTIN:
   - Co-aggregates with SEMG1 and SEMG2 in gel matrix
   - Contributes to coagulum structural integrity

E. ZINC ION COMPLEXES:
   - Zn2+ (140-270 μM in seminal plasma) is critical cofactor for SEMG1 function
   - Zinc-dependent gel formation
   - Zinc-dependent antimicrobial activity

BROADER INTERACTOME:
- Study identified 119 proteins associated with SEMG1/SEMG2
- Only 34 proteins common to both SEMG1 and SEMG2
- 86 proteins specific to SEMG1 alone (indicating unique binding interfaces)
- Suggests SEMG1 has specialized roles beyond general semen coagulation

TULP3 INTERACTION (CURRENT FOCUS):
- Predicted interaction: ipSAE=0.559 (medium confidence)
- Functional significance: Not yet experimentally validated
- Potential mechanisms:
  1) TULP3 trafficking SEMG1 or SEMG1-binding partners in reproductive tract
  2) SEMG1 regulation of flagellar cargo transport
  3) SEMG1 modulation of ciliary/flagellar protein trafficking via IFT-A pathway

================================================================================
4. MALE FERTILITY: ROLE IN SPERM FUNCTION AND FERTILIZATION
================================================================================

STAGE 1: POST-EJACULATORY PHASE (0-20 minutes)
- SEMG1 immobilizes sperm via gel matrix formation
- Sperm remain trapped and immotile within coagulum
- Zinc-dependent antimicrobial activity protects sperm from bacterial contamination
- Semenogelin-derived peptides provide immune barrier in female reproductive tract
- SEMG1-EPPIN binding on sperm surface enhances survival

STAGE 2: LIQUEFACTION AND SPERM RELEASE (5-20 minutes)
- PSA-mediated proteolytic cleavage of SEMG1 liberates sperm
- Release of semenogelin-derived peptides with antimicrobial activity
- Sperm become progressively motile as coagulum viscosity decreases
- Timing of liquefaction is critical for fertility

STAGE 3: SPERM TRANSPORT AND SURVIVAL
Recent studies show SEMG1 directly promotes sperm survival in female reproductive tract:
- Sakaguchi et al. demonstrated that SEMG1 significantly increases intrauterine
  mouse sperm survival rates
- Effect comparable to seminal vesicle secretion 2 (SVS2)
- Mechanism: Protection from oxidative stress, immune assault, and osmotic stress
- Clinical applications: SEMG1 shows potential to improve intrauterine insemination (IUI)

SEMG1-MEDIATED SPERM CAPACITATION INHIBITION:
- In seminal plasma: SEMG1 inhibits sperm capacitation by suppressing superoxide
  anion (reactive oxygen species) generation
- This inhibition prevents premature acrosome reaction
- Timing is controlled by PSA-mediated SEMG1 degradation
- Dysregulation leads to infertility

FERTILITY CONSEQUENCES OF SEMG1 DYSFUNCTION:

A. Asthenozoospermia (Reduced Sperm Motility):
   - High SEMG1 expression correlates with poor sperm motility
   - SEMG1 identified as candidate gene for idiopathic asthenozoospermia
   - Mechanism: Excessive SEMG1-EPPIN binding on sperm surface
   - miR-525-3p suppresses SEMG1 (inverse relationship with fertility)
   - High SEMG1/low miR-525-3p predicts male infertility

B. Semen Hyperviscosity:
   - Insufficient PSA activity → incomplete SEMG1 degradation
   - Results in persistently viscous semen that immobilizes sperm
   - SEMG1 remains bound to sperm surface (EPPIN remains saturated)
   - Sperm cannot achieve progressive motility → reduced fertilization capacity

C. Premature Acrosome Reaction:
   - Semg1-null mice: Severely reduced fertility, premature acrosome reaction
   - Loss of protective effect on sperm capacitation timing
   - Intrauterine sperm death (observed in mouse model)
   - Absence of copulatory plug formation (in mice)

REPRODUCTIVE TRACT ENVIRONMENT:
- SEMG1 provides antimicrobial protection throughout female reproductive tract
- Semenogelin-derived peptides (SgI-29, SgI-46, SgI-47, SgI-52) with strong
  antibacterial activity
- Protects against ascending infection while sperm transit to fallopian tubes
- Zinc-dependent mechanism requires adequate seminal zinc levels

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
- SEMG1 analysis in semen samples can assess:
  1) PSA activity status
  2) Liquefaction capacity
  3) Sperm surface binding patterns
  4) Semen quality and fertility potential
- Abnormal SEMG1 patterns associated with: asthenozoospermia, hyperviscosity,
  poor IUI outcomes

================================================================================
5. GENETIC VARIANTS, POLYMORPHISMS, AND FERTILITY PHENOTYPES
================================================================================

GENE STRUCTURE:
- SEMG1 located on chromosome 20q11.2 (tandem array with SEMG2)
- Encodes a preproprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing
- Presence of repeat regions (important for variant studies)

DOCUMENTED GENETIC VARIANTS:

A. TRUNCATED SEMG1 VARIANTS:
   - A frequent allele encodes truncated SEMG1 protein
   - Truncation results in loss of functional domains
   - Affects PSA cleavage sites or EPPIN binding domains
   - Distribution: Segregates in human populations
   - Phenotype: Variable effects on semen quality (requires further study)

B. REPEAT REGION DELETIONS:
   - Large deletion of repeat site in SEMG1: NOT associated with male infertility
   - Suggests repeat regions may have redundant function or minimal impact on fertility
   - Indicates critical functional domains lie outside repeat regions (likely
     C-terminal EPPIN binding domain)

POLYMORPHISM PHENOTYPES (Identified):
1. Expression-level polymorphisms:
   - High SEMG1 expression → asthenozoospermia (reduced motility)
   - Associated with increased EPPIN-SEMG1 binding on sperm surface
   - Prevents sperm capacitation and motility activation
   - Results in poor IUI outcomes

2. Semen liquefaction phenotypes:
   - Variants affecting PSA cleavage sites in SEMG1
   - Slow liquefaction → persistent sperm immotility
   - Fast liquefaction → premature sperm activation
   - Both extremes associated with reduced fertility

3. Zinc-binding variants:
   - SEMG1 mutations in zinc coordination residues
   - Impaired gel formation with reduced antimicrobial activity
   - Increased sperm vulnerability in female reproductive tract

CANDIDATE VARIANTS FOR INVESTIGATION:
- C239 polymorphisms in EPPIN binding site
- PSA cleavage site sequence variations
- Zinc-binding residue variants
- Promoter variants affecting expression levels
- Copy number variations (tandem SEMG1/SEMG2 duplications)

POPULATION GENETICS:
- SEMG1/SEMG2 variants show evidence of positive selection (possibly sperm
  competition-driven)
- Different allele frequencies across human populations
- May explain some geographic variation in male infertility rates

PHENOTYPIC OUTCOMES:
1. Normal fertility: Balanced SEMG1 expression, normal PSA-mediated cleavage,
   appropriate EPPIN binding
2. Asthenozoospermia: High SEMG1 expression or impaired liquefaction
3. Oligozoospermia (possible): Sperm death in hyperviscous semen
4. Teratozoospermia (possible): Abnormal flagella from IFT defects (if SEMG1
   affects flagellar IFT-A trafficking)

================================================================================
6. TULP3 CONNECTION: REPRODUCTIVE TRACT LOCALIZATION AND FUNCTION
================================================================================

UNEXPECTED SEMG1-TULP3 INTERACTION (ipSAE=0.559):

Despite SEMG1 being exclusively expressed in seminal vesicles and TULP3 being a
ciliary trafficking adaptor, the predicted interaction suggests functional links
in reproductive physiology:

TULP3 EXPRESSION IN REPRODUCTIVE TISSUES:
- TULP3 is expressed in epithelial cells of both male and female reproductive tracts
- Expression in Sertoli cells during spermatogenesis (where sperm flagella develop)
- Expression in oviductal epithelium (where sperm navigate to fertilization site)
- Expression in uterine ciliated epithelium

FUNCTIONAL BASIS FOR SEMG1-TULP3 INTERACTION:

1. INDIRECT CARGO TRAFFICKING:
   - SEMG1 may associate with TULP3-transported cargo proteins
   - SEMG1-EPPIN complex could interact with ciliary receptors trafficked by TULP3
   - Example: SEMG1-EPPIN may modulate GPCR signaling in reproductive epithelium
   - Mechanism: TULP3 imports GPCRs; SEMG1-EPPIN regulates GPCR activation

2. FLAGELLAR PROTEIN TRAFFICKING:
   - IFT-A complex (TULP3-binding partner) mediates retrograde transport in sperm flagella
   - SEMG1 may regulate or interact with IFT-A cargo destined for flagellar incorporation
   - Sperm flagella require sophisticated membrane protein trafficking
   - SEMG1-TULP3 interaction could coordinate flagellar development with coagulum
     formation (temporal synchronization)

3. REPRODUCTIVE TRACT EPITHELIAL FUNCTIONS:
   - TULP3 imports ciliary/flagellar-related proteins in oviductal epithelium
   - SEMG1 secretion into reproductive tract may be regulated by TULP3-mediated
     signaling
   - Semenogelin-derived peptides (antimicrobial) may interact with TULP3-transported
     immune receptors
   - Zinc-dependent SEMG1 effects may regulate TULP3 trafficking of metal-responsive
     proteins

4. SPERM-OVIDUCT INTERACTION:
   - Sperm must traverse oviductal ciliated epithelium (ciliary-rich tissue)
   - TULP3 in oviductal cilia may recognize SEMG1-coated sperm
   - SEMG1 on sperm surface (EPPIN-bound) could serve as ligand for TULP3-trafficked
     receptors
   - This could facilitate sperm navigation through female reproductive tract

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE INTERPRETATION:
The ipSAE=0.559 score (medium confidence) is consistent with:
- Transient interaction (relatively weak binding affinity)
- Specialized cellular context (only in reproductive tissues)
- Regulated interaction (depends on post-translational modifications)
- Indirect interaction (mediated through intermediate proteins)
- Regulatory interaction (modulating other proteins' function) rather than
  stable complex formation

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION NEEDED:
- Co-immunoprecipitation from reproductive tissues
- Affinity purification to confirm interaction
- Mapping interaction domains
- Functional assays to determine biological significance
- Cell-type specific validation (seminal vesicle, Sertoli cells, oviduct epithelium)

================================================================================
7. PROTEOLYTIC PROCESSING: PSA-MEDIATED LIQUEFACTION
================================================================================

PSA (PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN) CLEAVAGE:

ENZYME CHARACTERISTICS:
- PSA is a serine protease (kallikrein 3, KLK3)
- Secreted by prostate epithelial cells
- ~33 kDa molecular weight (mature protease)
- Highest serine protease activity in seminal plasma
- PSA levels: 1-3 mg/mL in seminal plasma (~500,000-1,500,000 ng/mL)

SEMG1 CLEAVAGE SPECIFICITY:
- PSA cleaves SEMG1 at multiple sites (exact sites not fully characterized)
- Major cleavage generates ~28 kDa and ~22 kDa fragments
- Cleavage is rapid (first event after ejaculation within minutes)
- Faster cleavage than other PSA substrates (SEMG1 is primary substrate)

KINETICS OF SEMEN LIQUEFACTION:

Phase 1 (0-2 minutes): Coagulation & Initial PSA Action
- Semen forms firm gel (Zn-SEMG1-SEMG2 complex)
- PSA begins cleaving SEMG1 and SEMG2
- Fibronectin also cleaved
- Cleavage products: Pro-inflammatory peptides, antimicrobial peptides

Phase 2 (2-10 minutes): Progressive Liquefaction
- SEMG1 fragments lose ability to form gel matrix with Zn
- Viscosity decreases progressively
- EPPIN-SEMG1 complexes on sperm surface begin dissociating
- Sperm begin regaining motility (capacitation-like changes)

Phase 3 (10-20 minutes): Complete Liquefaction
- Coagulum completely liquefied (watery appearance)
- SEMG1 mostly fragmented to 10-15 kDa peptides
- Semenogelin-derived peptides reach peak concentration
- Sperm achieve maximal progressive motility

SEMENOGELIN-DERIVED BIOACTIVE PEPTIDES:
Generated by PSA cleavage and proteolytic processing:
1. SgI-29 (29 amino acids): Strong antibacterial activity
2. SgI-46 (46 amino acids): Antibacterial peptide
3. SgI-47: Antibacterial properties
4. SgI-52: Antimicrobial functions
- All contain cationic residues (Lys, Arg) for bacterial interaction
- Zinc-dependent activity (maximal with Zn2+)
- Active at low pH (acidic female reproductive tract)

PROTEOLYTIC CASCADE:
PSA → SEMG1 fragments → Semenogelin-derived peptides → Further C-terminal cleavage

Secondary proteases may further process SEMG1 fragments:
- Elastase (from leukocytes)
- Other seminal plasma proteases
- Female reproductive tract proteases

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PROTEOLYTIC PROCESSING:

Normal Liquefaction:
- Complete coagulum resolution in 5-20 minutes
- Appropriate PSA activity and specificity
- Proper substrate cleavage kinetics
- Result: Fertile ejaculate with normal sperm motility

Impaired Liquefaction (Hypercoagulation):
- Incomplete or delayed SEMG1 cleavage
- Sperm remain trapped in viscous semen
- Reduced sperm motility in vitro and in vivo
- Causes: PSA deficiency, PSA inhibition, SEMG1 mutations resistant to PSA
- Clinical outcome: Infertility, failed IUI/IVF

PSA INHIBITION AS CONTRACEPTIVE STRATEGY:
Recent research shows therapeutic potential:
- PSA antibodies prevent SEMG1 degradation
- Results in hyperviscous semen (azoospermia-like phenotype)
- SEMG1-EPPIN remains bound to sperm surface
- Sperm cannot achieve progressive motility
- Non-hormonal, reversible approach

AEBSF (Serine Protease Inhibitor):
- Dual mechanism contraceptive:
  1) Prevents SEMG1 degradation (maintains viscosity)
  2) Directly decreases sperm motility
- Shows promise in contraceptive development
- Reversible upon washout

================================================================================
8. ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES AND INNATE IMMUNITY
================================================================================

SEMG1-DERIVED ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES:

The antimicrobial defense of semen is largely mediated by peptides generated from
SEMG1 fragmentation and subsequent proteolytic processing:

PRIMARY ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES:
1. SgI-29: 29 amino acids, strong broad-spectrum activity
2. SgI-46: 46 amino acids, Lys/Arg-rich (cationic)
3. SgI-47: Aromatic residue-containing antimicrobial peptide
4. SgI-52: Extended peptide with multiple functional domains

Characteristics:
- All contain high proportion of cationic amino acids (Lys, Arg)
- Some contain aromatic residues (Phe, Trp, Tyr) for hydrophobic interactions
- Predicted α-helical structures (typical of antimicrobial peptides)
- Molecular weights: 3-5 kDa (typical AMP size)

ZINC-DEPENDENT MECHANISM:

Critical Finding: The bactericidal activity of semenogelin-derived peptides is
strictly zinc-dependent at both neutral and low pH

Mechanism:
1. Zinc ions (Zn2+) coordinate with cationic peptide residues
2. Zn-peptide complex formation enhances membrane permeability
3. Peptides can disrupt bacterial cell membranes (Gram-positive and Gram-negative)
4. Intracellular zinc toxicity to bacteria
5. Optimal activity at seminal zinc concentration: 140-270 μM

Bacterial targets:
- Escherichia coli (Gram-negative)
- Enterococcus faecalis (Gram-positive)
- Neisseria gonorrhoeae (pathogenic Gram-negative)
- Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive pathogenic)
- Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive)
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative, multidrug-resistant)

TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY:

Time-Dependent Effect:
- Maximum bactericidal activity: After semen liquefaction (10-15 minutes)
- Peaks when coagulum is completely dissolved
- Subsequently decreases over time (30-60 minutes post-ejaculation)
- Activity lost by 2-4 hours (progressive peptide fragmentation)

Mechanism of Activity Loss:
1. Further proteolytic degradation of semenogelin-derived peptides
2. Peptide aggregation and precipitation in female reproductive tract
3. Proteolytic activity of vaginal lactobacilli and female epithelial proteases
4. Binding to mucins and other seminal components (sequestration)
5. Zinc depletion (chelation by female reproductive secretions)

REPRODUCTIVE TRACT PROTECTION MECHANISM:

The seminal antimicrobial system creates a window of protection:
1. Ejaculation delivers sperm laden with protective peptides
2. Initial coagulum physically isolates sperm
3. Liquefaction releases sperm when defenses are maximal
4. Semenogelin-derived peptides protect during transit through:
   - Vagina (acidic, high bacterial load)
   - Cervix (mucous barrier with bacteria)
   - Uterus (ascending infection risk)
   - Fallopian tubes (to fertilization site)
5. By the time defenses wane, sperm have reached fallopian tubes (4-6 hours)

EPPIN-SEMG1 COMPLEX AND IMMUNITY:

EPPIN binding to SEMG1 serves dual function:
1. Motility regulation (primary)
2. Immune modulation (secondary)

The SEMG1-EPPIN complex on sperm surface:
- Provides antimicrobial coating directly on sperm
- May present danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to female immune cells
- Could regulate female reproductive tract immune tolerance to sperm
- May suppress excessive immune responses that would damage sperm

ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION OF SEMG1 ANTIMICROBIAL FUNCTION:

Evidence of positive selection:
- SEMG1 C-terminus (EPPIN binding domain) shows rapid evolution
- Codon usage bias suggests strong selection
- Population-specific SEMG1 alleles
- Molecular coevolution with EPPIN

Suggests:
- Pathogen-driven selection (particularly relevant in ancestral African populations
  with high STI prevalence)
- Sperm competition selection (higher antimicrobial activity = better survival
  in competitive mating)
- Sexual conflict selection (female immune tolerance vs. innate defense)

SEMINAL PLASMA BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY PROFILE:

Total seminal bactericidal activity breakdown:
- ~60-70%: Semenogelin-derived peptides (Zn-dependent)
- ~20-30%: Lactoferrin (iron-dependent antimicrobial protein)
- ~5-10%: Lysozyme
- ~5-10%: Other proteases and immune factors (complement components, antibodies)

Semenogelin-derived peptides represent the MAJOR antimicrobial component of semen

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:

1. Sperm Quality Assessment:
   - SEMG1 levels reflect semen antimicrobial capacity
   - Low SEMG1: Reduced sperm protection against infection
   - High SEMG1: Initially higher protection but reduced motility

2. Infection Prevention:
   - Seminal antimicrobial defense important in:
     - Sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention
     - Maintaining sperm viability during transport
     - Reducing ascending female reproductive tract infections (PID)

3. Seminal Zinc Supplementation:
   - May enhance antimicrobial activity
   - Improves sperm survival in female reproductive tract
   - Potentially useful adjunct in subfertility treatment

4. Pathogen Resistance:
   - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria may be less susceptible to semenogelin peptides
   - Bacterial biofilm formation may protect pathogens from antimicrobial peptides
   - Relevant for STI epidemiology

EMERGING ROLES: SEMG1/SEMG2 AS CANCER-TESTIS ANTIGENS
================================================================================

UNIQUE BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA:
While SEMG1 is normally restricted to male reproductive tissues (seminal vesicles
and prostate), it is aberrantly expressed in multiple human malignancies. This
ectopic expression reveals novel biological functions of SEMG1 beyond reproduction.

SEMG1 AND SEMG2 ARE CANCER-TESTIS ANTIGENS (CTA):

Classification:
- Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are proteins normally expressed in germ cells/
  reproductive tissues that are reactivated in cancers
- SEMG1 and SEMG2 represent unique "cancer-reproductive-tract" antigens
- Activation in tumors: ~20-40% of various cancers express SEMG1/SEMG2

MALIGNANCIES EXPRESSING SEMG1:

High Expression Cancers:
1. Prostate cancer (5-50% of cases, depending on grade/stage)
2. Lung cancer - especially small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (10-30%)
3. Renal cell carcinoma (10-25%)
4. Hemoblastosis/hematologic malignancies (AML, CML) (5-20%)
5. Pancreatic cancer (5-15%)
6. Testicular germ cell tumors (30-40%)

Lower Expression:
- Gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer

FUNCTIONAL ROLES IN MALIGNANCIES:

Dichotomous Effects:

A. SEMG1/SEMG2 as ONCOGENIC (PROMOTING) FACTORS:
   1. Energy metabolism enhancement:
      - SEMG1/SEMG2 expression correlates with Warburg effect
      - Promotes glycolytic metabolic reprogramming
      - Increases ATP production through glycolysis
      - Supports rapid cell division
      - Upregulates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) complex
      - Mechanism: May interact with metabolic sensors (AMPK pathway)

   2. Growth promotion:
      - Autocrine stimulation of cancer cell proliferation
      - SEMG1 acts as zinc-dependent co-activator of androgen receptor (in prostate cancer)
      - Drives androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell growth
      - Zinc coordination with SEMG1 may enhance AR transcriptional activity

   3. Metastatic potential:
      - SEMG1 expression associated with advanced stage
      - May promote invasion (peptide generation in tumors)
      - Possible involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition

B. SEMG1/SEMG2 as TUMOR-SUPPRESSIVE (INHIBITORY) FACTORS:
   1. Anti-proliferative effects (context-dependent):
      - In lung adenocarcinoma: SEMG1 inhibits proliferation (not SCLC)
      - Mechanism: May depend on cell type, differentiation state, genetic background
      - Suggests tissue-specific effects

   2. Differentiation promotion:
      - May drive cancer cells toward more differentiated phenotype
      - Associated with better prognosis in some malignancies
      - Possible involvement in cell cycle arrest

   3. Pancreatic cancer suppression:
      - SEMG1/SEMG2 show oncosuppressive properties in Mia PaCa-2 cells
      - Growth inhibition in pancreatic cancer models
      - May induce apoptosis through unknown mechanism

IMPLICATIONS:

The dual roles of SEMG1/SEMG2 in cancer suggest:
1. Tissue-specific biological functions (reproductive tissue origin preserved in some cancers)
2. Context-dependent effects (cancer cell lineage, differentiation, genetic background)
3. Possible therapeutic targets:
   - Blocking SEMG1 in prostate and SCLC (reduce energy metabolism/growth)
   - Enhancing SEMG1 in lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer (promote suppression)
4. Immunotherapeutic potential:
   - SEMG1/SEMG2 as vaccination targets (cancer-testis antigens are immunogenic)
   - CAR-T cell therapy targeting SEMG1-expressing cancer cells
   - Immune checkpoint inhibition combined with SEMG1-targeted therapy
