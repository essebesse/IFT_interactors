- Gene: SPATA7 (Spermatogenesis-Associated Protein 7)
- UniProt ID: Q9P0W8
- Chromosomal location: 14q31.3

================================================================================
1. KNOWN CILIARY ROLE AND LOCALIZATION
================================================================================

DISTAL CONNECTING CILIUM MAINTENANCE:
SPATA7 maintains a novel photoreceptor-specific zone in the distal connecting
cilium (DCC), which is a photoreceptor-specific extension of the ciliary
transition zone. The connecting cilium (CC) of photoreceptors can be
partitioned into two distinct regions:

1. PROXIMAL CC (PCC): Homologous to the transition zone of primary cilia
2. DISTAL CC (DCC): Photoreceptor-specific extension maintained by SPATA7

SPATA7 is distributed throughout the entire length of the CC, suggesting the
entire CC may contribute to the gate function. The absence of SPATA7 results
in the mislocalization of DCC proteins without affecting the PCC protein
complexes.

  DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201712117

MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT:
SPATA7 is required not only for the establishment but also for the maintenance
of the connecting cilium of photoreceptors. Close examination revealed
significantly shortened NPHP1 length as a result of Spata7 deletion, and
mislocalization of rhodopsin leading to ER stress-mediated apoptosis.

- Connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells

================================================================================
2. PHOTORECEPTOR FUNCTION AND OUTER SEGMENT DISC MORPHOGENESIS
================================================================================

SCAFFOLD PROTEIN FUNCTION:
SPATA7 encodes a putative scaffold protein that is essential for proper
assembly of the connecting cilium complex in photoreceptors. The protein
facilitates protein trafficking through the connecting cilium to the outer
segment, where rhodopsin and other phototransduction proteins reside.

OUTER SEGMENT MORPHOGENESIS:
Loss of SPATA7 disrupts the protein trafficking process, leading to:
- Ectopic accumulation of proteins within the inner segment
- Mislocalization of rhodopsin (leading to ER stress-mediated apoptosis)
- Destabilization of axonemal microtubules
- Disorganization of photoreceptor outer segments (OS)
- Significant rhodopsin mislocalization

PHOTORECEPTOR DEGENERATION:
- Progressive reduction of photoresponse from postnatal day 15 (P15)
- Significant photoreceptor degeneration
- Both rod and cone photoreceptors affected
- Loss alters both rod and cone function and survival

================================================================================

SPATA7 KNOCKOUT MOUSE MODELS:

GERMLINE NULL MICE (Spata7−/−):
Spata7 knockout mice mimic human SPATA7-related retinal disease with:
- Apparent photoreceptor degeneration observed as early as postnatal day 15
  (P15)
- Progressive reduction of photoresponse from P15
- Significant rhodopsin mislocalization
- Photoreceptor degeneration and disorganization of outer segments

PROGRESSION TIMELINE:
- P15: Early onset of degeneration
- P28: Progressive thinning of outer nuclear layer (ONL) begins
- 1 month: ~50% of photoreceptor cells still survive and are functional
  (ERG assay)
- 6 months: 30-40% of photoreceptor cells remain compared to wild-type
- Long-term: Progressive but incomplete degeneration

CONDITIONAL KNOCKOUT STUDIES:

PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC DELETION (Spata7Flox/−; Crx-Cre):
Conditional deletion of Spata7 in photoreceptors resulted in:
- Strong photoreceptor phenotype
- Progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells
- Concomitant loss of retinal function
- Progressive thinning of the ONL starting at P28
- Alters both rod and cone function and survival

KEY FINDING: Loss of Spata7 in photoreceptors alone is SUFFICIENT to cause
photoreceptor degeneration.

RPE-SPECIFIC STUDIES:
- Cross sections of 2.5-month-old RPE-specific Spata7 cKO retinas show NO
  obvious photoreceptor degeneration
- Retinas appear normal compared to control sections

CONCLUSION: Spata7 function in the RPE is NOT required for photoreceptor
survival. The photoreceptor-autonomous role is critical.

================================================================================
6. TRANSITION ZONE ROLE AND CILIARY BARRIER FUNCTION
================================================================================

PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC TRANSITION ZONE ARCHITECTURE:

The photoreceptor connecting cilium contains TWO functionally distinct zones:

1. PROXIMAL CONNECTING CILIUM (PCC)
   - Homologous to the canonical transition zone of primary cilia
   - Contains conserved transition zone proteins
   - NOT dependent on SPATA7 for maintenance
   - Proteins remain properly localized in Spata7−/− mice

2. DISTAL CONNECTING CILIUM (DCC)
   - Photoreceptor-specific extension of the transition zone
   - REQUIRES SPATA7 for maintenance
   - Contains DCC-specific proteins: RPGR, RPGRIP1
   - Lost or mislocalized when SPATA7 is absent

SPATA7 AS A TRANSITION ZONE ORGANIZER:
SPATA7 is distributed throughout the entire length of the connecting cilium,
suggesting the entire CC may contribute to the gate/barrier function. This
specialized distal zone is maintained by SPATA7, which interacts with other
photoreceptor-specific ciliary proteins.

REFERENCE:
- Dharmat R, et al. SPATA7 maintains a novel photoreceptor-specific zone in
  the distal connecting cilium. J Cell Biol. 2018;217(8):2851-2865.
  PMID: 29899041
  DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201712117

TRANSITION ZONE PROTEINS SELECTIVELY AFFECTED:

In mouse photoreceptors, disruption of Spata7 selectively DISLODGES several
conserved TZ proteins from the DISTAL region (but NOT proximal region) of the
connecting cilium:
- AHI1 (Jouberin)
- NPHP1 (Nephrocystin-1)
- NPHP4 (Nephrocystin-4)
- CEP290 (Centrosomal Protein 290)
- RPGRIP1
- RPGR

This selective effect demonstrates that SPATA7 specifically maintains the
distal compartment of the transition zone.

CILIARY GATING MECHANISM:

Members of transition zone protein complexes interact among themselves and
enable associations between the axoneme and the ciliary membrane, thereby
maintaining the ciliary gate/barrier that regulates:
1. Ciliogenesis
2. Protein trafficking within the cilium
3. Ciliary autonomy and homeostasis

PROPOSED MECHANISMS FOR TRANSITION ZONE BARRIER:
- Unique complement and spatial organization of proteins spanning from
  microtubule-based axoneme to ciliary membrane
- Protein "picket fence" model
- Specialized lipid microdomain
- Differential membrane curvature and thickness
- Size-selective molecular sieve

  and assembling the gate. Mol Cells. 2017;40(4):243-253.

  DOI: 10.15252/embr.202255420
  PMC: PMC9724682

CONSEQUENCES OF TRANSITION ZONE DISRUPTION:

When SPATA7 is lost, the ciliary barrier function is compromised:
- Mislocalization of DCC proteins
- Destabilization of axonemal microtubules
- Disrupted protein trafficking to outer segment
- Rhodopsin mislocalization
- Ectopic protein accumulation in inner segment
- ER stress-mediated apoptosis
- Photoreceptor degeneration

This demonstrates that SPATA7-mediated maintenance of the distal transition
zone is ESSENTIAL for:
- Proper protein trafficking
- Outer segment homeostasis
- Photoreceptor survival

COMPARISON WITH OTHER CILIOPATHIES:

SPATA7-related disease shares features with other transition zone ciliopathies:
- RPGRIP1L: Controls CEP290 levels at vertebrate TZ
- CEP290: Major TZ protein, mutations cause LCA and ciliopathies
- NPHP1, NPHP4: Nephronophthisis proteins, kidney and retinal disease
- AHI1: Joubert syndrome

However, SPATA7 is UNIQUE in maintaining a photoreceptor-SPECIFIC extension
of the transition zone (the DCC), rather than the canonical transition zone
present in all cilia.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
Understanding SPATA7's role in transition zone maintenance is critical for:
- Predicting disease phenotypes
- Designing therapeutic interventions
- Identifying drug targets
- Understanding retinal ciliopathies
- Developing gene therapy approaches

================================================================================
7. TULP3 CONNECTION AND FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS
================================================================================

INTERACTION CONTEXT:
- ipSAE score: 0.595 (Medium confidence prediction)
- TULP3: IFT-A cargo adaptor for ciliary GPCR trafficking
- SPATA7: Distal connecting cilium maintenance protein
- Both critical for photoreceptor cilia function

TULP3 (TUBBY-LIKE PROTEIN 3) FUNCTION:

PRIMARY ROLE:
TULP3 is involved in trafficking GPCRs to primary cilia. RNAi knockdown of
TULP3 decreased trafficking of some GPCRs to cilia without affecting
ciliogenesis. The interaction of TULP3 with IFT-A and phosphoinositides
(PI(4,5)P2) is required for trafficking of particular GPCRs to cilia.

BBSome-TULP3 INTERACTION:
In primary cilia, BBSome-dependent removal of activated receptors requires
adapter proteins including TULP3, which is a PI(4,5)P2 binding protein.

  PMID: 20889716
  DOI: 10.1101/gad.1966210
  PMC: PMC2947765

PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:

SHARED PHOTORECEPTOR LOCALIZATION:
Both SPATA7 and TULP3 are critical for photoreceptor function:
- SPATA7: Maintains distal connecting cilium integrity
- TULP3: Cargo adaptor for ciliary trafficking (in other ciliated cells)

POTENTIAL FUNCTIONAL LINKS:
While direct experimental evidence for SPATA7-TULP3 interaction in
photoreceptors is limited in the literature, several functional connections
are plausible:

1. CILIARY TRAFFICKING PATHWAY:
   - TULP3 mediates IFT-A-dependent cargo delivery
   - SPATA7 maintains the ciliary gate through which cargo must pass
   - Coordinated function may ensure proper trafficking

2. PHOTORECEPTOR OUTER SEGMENT DELIVERY:
   - Photoreceptors require massive ciliary trafficking of rhodopsin and other
     phototransduction proteins
   - SPATA7 maintains the connecting cilium infrastructure
   - TULP3 family proteins may participate in cargo selection/delivery

3. IFT-A COMPLEX CONNECTION:
   - TULP3 bridges IFT-A complex to membrane phosphoinositides
   - IFT proteins traffic through the connecting cilium
   - SPATA7-maintained distal CC may regulate IFT-A complex passage

TULP FAMILY IN PHOTORECEPTORS:

TULP1 (TUBBY-LIKE PROTEIN 1):
TULP1 is well-characterized in photoreceptors:
- Localizes to photoreceptor inner segments and synapses
- Mutations cause retinitis pigmentosa
- Involved in vesicular trafficking
- Compartment-specific interactomes characterized

  DOI: 10.1016/j.exer.2021.108683
  PMC: PMC8348715

TULP3 vs TULP1 IN RETINA:
While TULP1 is extensively studied in photoreceptors, TULP3's specific role
in photoreceptor cilia is less well-defined. TULP3 may function in:
- Ciliary GPCR trafficking (established in other cilia)
- Coordination with SPATA7 for connecting cilium function
- IFT-mediated delivery of outer segment components

FUNCTIONAL HYPOTHESIS FOR SPATA7-TULP3 INTERACTION:

SPATA7 maintains the structural integrity and gating function of the distal
connecting cilium, creating a selective barrier. TULP3, as a cargo adaptor,
may interact with or depend on SPATA7-maintained structures to:
1. Deliver specific ciliary cargos through the connecting cilium
2. Coordinate with the transition zone gate for selective trafficking
3. Ensure proper localization of GPCRs or other signaling proteins in
   photoreceptor outer segments

EVIDENCE GAP:
Currently, there is LIMITED direct experimental evidence in the literature for
SPATA7-TULP3 physical or functional interaction specifically in photoreceptors.
The AlphaFold prediction (ipSAE=0.595) suggests a potential interaction that
warrants further experimental investigation.

SUGGESTED EXPERIMENTS TO VALIDATE INTERACTION:
1. Co-immunoprecipitation in retinal tissue or photoreceptor cells
2. Proximity ligation assay in photoreceptors
3. Analysis of TULP3 localization in Spata7−/− mice
4. Assessment of SPATA7 localization in TULP3 knockout retinas
5. Super-resolution microscopy to examine co-localization at connecting cilium
6. Functional trafficking assays in double mutant models

BROADER CILIARY CONTEXT:

SPATA7 AND CARGO TRAFFICKING:
Loss of SPATA7 disrupts the protein trafficking process through the connecting
cilium, leading to:
- Mislocalization of rhodopsin
- Ectopic accumulation of proteins in inner segment
- ER stress and apoptosis

If TULP3 participates in photoreceptor ciliary trafficking, SPATA7 may be
required to maintain the ciliary infrastructure through which TULP3-mediated
trafficking occurs.

COMPARTMENTALIZATION:
Photoreceptor sensory cilia are highly compartmentalized:
- Inner segment: Biosynthesis
- Connecting cilium: Selective trafficking barrier (SPATA7-dependent)
- Outer segment: Phototransduction machinery

TULP3, as a cargo adaptor, may participate in maintaining this
compartmentalization alongside SPATA7's structural role.

  PMC: PMC7889997

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
Understanding the SPATA7-TULP3 relationship may inform:
- Mechanisms of LCA3 pathogenesis
- Potential combinatorial gene therapy approaches
- Ciliary trafficking defects in retinal disease
- Broader understanding of photoreceptor ciliopathies

CONCLUSION:
While TULP3 and SPATA7 both play critical roles in ciliary function and
photoreceptor biology, direct experimental validation of their interaction in
photoreceptors is needed. The AlphaFold-predicted interaction (ipSAE=0.595)
provides a testable hypothesis for future research.

================================================================================

PRECLINICAL AAV GENE THERAPY:

AAV8(Y733F) VECTOR STUDIES:
To test the efficacy of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy for
rescue of photoreceptor survival and function in Spata7 mutant mice,
researchers employed the AAV8(Y733F) vector carrying hGRK1-driven full-length

TREATMENT OUTCOMES:

EARLY INTERVENTION (P15):
In Spata7 mutant mice initially treated at P15, researchers observed:
- Improvement of photoresponse
- Improved photoreceptor ultrastructure
- Significant alleviation of photoreceptor degeneration

DELAYED INTERVENTIONS (P28, P56):
Treatments at later timepoints (P28 and P56) demonstrated that:
- All treatments (P15-P56) can ameliorate rod and cone loss
- Long-term efficacy (1 year follow-up)
- Improvement sustained even with delayed treatment

THERAPEUTIC WINDOW:
The ability to achieve benefit even with P56 treatment suggests a relatively
broad therapeutic window, which is clinically important for human translation.

LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES:

PROGRESSIVE DEGENERATION PERSISTS:
This study demonstrates long-term improvement of photoreceptor function by
AAV8(Y733F)-introduced Spata7 expression in a mouse model as potential
treatment of the human disease, but also suggests that treated mutant
photoreceptors still undergo PROGRESSIVE DEGENERATION.

This finding indicates:
- Gene therapy slows but may not completely halt degeneration
- Combined therapeutic approaches may be needed
- Early intervention likely provides better outcomes
- Long-term monitoring of treated patients will be essential

VECTOR CONSIDERATIONS:
- AAV8(Y733F): Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at position 733
- Enhanced transduction efficiency compared to wild-type AAV8
- hGRK1 promoter: Targets both rods and cones
- Full-length SPATA7 cDNA required (complete protein)

HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS:

CURRENT STATUS:
Based on extensive literature searches, NO active human clinical trials for
SPATA7 gene therapy were identified as of 2024. The research appears to be in
the preclinical/animal model stage.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER LCA GENE THERAPIES:
Other LCA subtypes have progressed much further:
- LCA2 (RPE65 mutations): FDA-approved gene therapy (Luxturna/voretigene
  neparvovec)
- Multiple other LCA genes in clinical development

BARRIERS TO CLINICAL TRANSLATION:

1. RARITY OF SPATA7-LCA:
   - Only 1.7-3% of LCA cases
   - Small patient population may limit commercial interest
   - Challenges in recruiting sufficient patients for trials

2. PHOTORECEPTOR VIABILITY:
   - Severe early-onset disease
   - Rapid photoreceptor loss
   - May have narrow therapeutic window in humans
   - Requires early diagnosis and intervention

3. INCOMPLETE RESCUE IN PRECLINICAL MODELS:
   - Progressive degeneration continues even with treatment
   - Need for improved vectors or combination therapies

4. NATURAL HISTORY DATA NEEDED:
   - Better understanding of disease progression
   - Identification of optimal treatment timing
   - Biomarkers for treatment response

FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR THERAPY DEVELOPMENT:

1. IMPROVED AAV VECTORS:
   - Novel capsids with enhanced photoreceptor transduction
   - Optimized promoters for sustained expression
   - Smaller vector designs if possible

2. COMBINATION APPROACHES:
   - Gene therapy + neuroprotection
   - Gene therapy + anti-apoptotic agents
   - Gene therapy + cell therapy

3. EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES:
   - Newborn screening for SPATA7 mutations
   - Presymptomatic treatment protocols
   - Pediatric gene therapy protocols

4. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   - CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
   - Read-through therapy for nonsense mutations (93% of mutations are
     truncating)
   - Antisense oligonucleotides for splice mutations
   - Pharmacological chaperones

REFERENCE FOR RETINAL GENE THERAPIES:
- Multiple reviews discuss the landscape of retinal gene therapies, though
  SPATA7 is not yet in clinical trials:

    approaches in inherited retinal dystrophies"
  * Molecular Diagnosis & Therapy: "Gene Therapies in Clinical Development to
    Treat Retinal Disorders" (2024)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT:

1. PATIENT REGISTRIES:
   - Establish SPATA7-LCA patient registries
   - Natural history studies
   - Genotype-phenotype correlation studies

2. BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENT:
   - OCT-based structural biomarkers
   - Autofluorescence imaging protocols
   - ERG parameters for treatment response
   - Molecular biomarkers in blood/tears

3. COMPASSIONATE USE:
   - Consider expanded access protocols
   - Single-patient IND applications
   - Collaborative international efforts

4. FUNDING AND COLLABORATION:
   - Foundation for Fighting Blindness support
   - NIH funding for rare disease gene therapy
   - Industry partnerships
   - International consortia

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

- Early treatment of infants (consent issues)
- Risk-benefit balance for progressive but not immediately life-threatening
  condition
- Access and equity for rare disease therapies
- Long-term follow-up requirements

CONCLUSION:
While AAV-mediated gene therapy for SPATA7-related LCA shows promise in
preclinical studies with long-term photoreceptor rescue, significant work
remains before human clinical trials. The demonstrated therapeutic window and
partial rescue in mouse models provide a foundation for continued development,
but additional optimization and patient characterization are needed.

9. EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION
================================================================================

SPATA7 IN VERTEBRATES:

MAMMALIAN MODELS:
SPATA7 orthologs have been identified and studied in multiple mammalian
species:

1. MOUSE (Mus musculus):
   - Gene: Spata7
   - UniProt: Q80VP2
   - Well-characterized knockout and conditional knockout models
   - Retinal degeneration phenotype similar to human disease
   - Extensively used for gene therapy studies

2. RAT (Rattus norvegicus):
   - Gene: Spata7
   - UniProt: Q9R0A3
   - Less extensively studied than mouse

3. HUMAN (Homo sapiens):
   - Gene: SPATA7
   - UniProt: Q9P0W8
   - Chromosome 14q31.3
   - Disease-causing mutations well-characterized

CONSERVATION ACROSS VERTEBRATES:

ZEBRAFISH AS A MODEL:
While specific SPATA7 ortholog studies in zebrafish were not extensively
detailed in search results, zebrafish serve as important vertebrate models for
human ocular genetics:
- 71% of human genes have at least one zebrafish ortholog
- 69% of zebrafish genes have at least one human ortholog
- 82% of human disease genes in OMIM have a zebrafish ortholog
- 76% of human GWAS genes have zebrafish orthologs

This suggests SPATA7 likely has a zebrafish ortholog, though specific
functional studies were not found.

PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC EVOLUTION:

The distal connecting cilium (DCC) maintained by SPATA7 appears to be a
PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC structure, representing an evolutionary adaptation for
the specialized ciliary trafficking demands of photoreceptors.

PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC FEATURES:
- Massive outer segment membrane renewal (~2000 discs in human rods)
- Continuous trafficking of rhodopsin and phototransduction proteins
- Specialized ciliary compartmentalization
- Extended connecting cilium beyond canonical transition zone

This suggests SPATA7's role in maintaining the DCC may be specific to
vertebrate photoreceptors with elaborate outer segments.

CILIOPATHY PROTEIN MODULE CONSERVATION:

SPATA7 interacts with highly conserved ciliopathy proteins:
- RPGRIP1: Conserved in vertebrates
- RPGR: Vertebrate photoreceptor protein
- NPHP1, NPHP4: Highly conserved transition zone proteins
- CEP290: Ancient ciliary protein (conserved across eukaryotes)

The module of interacting proteins suggests ancient ciliary functions adapted
for specialized photoreceptor needs.

GENE STRUCTURE AND PROTEIN FEATURES:

LIMITED INFORMATION ON DOMAIN CONSERVATION:
Search results did not provide detailed information on:
- Conserved protein domains across species
- Predicted coiled-coil regions
- Transmembrane domain conservation
- Functional motifs

This represents a knowledge gap that would benefit from:
- Comparative genomics studies
- Structural prediction across orthologs
- Functional domain mapping

EXPRESSION PATTERNS:

TISSUE SPECIFICITY:
Human SPATA7 shows specific expression in:
- Photoreceptor cells (retina)
- Testis/spermatocytes (original naming source)

The dual expression pattern (retina and testis) suggests potential roles in:
- Specialized cilia (photoreceptor connecting cilium)
- Flagella (sperm tail)
- Both structures share ciliary machinery

RETINA-SPECIFIC FUNCTION:
Despite the "spermatogenesis-associated" name, SPATA7's critical function
appears to be in photoreceptor cilia maintenance, with disease manifestations
exclusively retinal (no reported male infertility in SPATA7-LCA patients).

DISEASE GENE CONSERVATION:

LCA-ASSOCIATED GENES:
SPATA7 is one of at least 15 genes causing LCA. Many LCA genes are highly
conserved ciliary or photoreceptor proteins:
- CEP290 (ciliopathy)
- CRB1 (apical polarity)
- GUCY2D (phototransduction)
- RPE65 (visual cycle)

This conservation underscores the fundamental importance of these pathways for
vertebrate vision.

EVOLUTIONARY INSIGHTS FROM DISEASE:

PHOTORECEPTOR CILIUM SPECIALIZATION:
The existence of photoreceptor-specific LCA genes like SPATA7 highlights the
evolutionary specialization of the photoreceptor cilium:
- Extended from canonical transition zone (DCC)
- Specialized trafficking machinery
- Unique protein complexes (RPGR, RPGRIP1)

CILIARY DIVERSITY:
SPATA7's role demonstrates that even within a single organism, different
ciliary types (motile, primary, photoreceptor) have evolved distinct molecular
architectures and regulatory proteins.

VERTEBRATE-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS:

The elaborate outer segment of vertebrate photoreceptors represents a major
evolutionary innovation for vision:
- Increased light-capturing surface area
- Compartmentalized phototransduction machinery
- Continuous disc renewal and turnover

SPATA7's function in maintaining the connecting cilium infrastructure supports
this specialized adaptation, suggesting it evolved alongside the elaboration
of vertebrate photoreceptor outer segments.

COMPARISON WITH INVERTEBRATE PHOTORECEPTORS:
Invertebrate photoreceptors (e.g., Drosophila) use rhabdomeric (microvillar)
rather than ciliary architectures. The absence of elaborate ciliary outer
segments suggests SPATA7-like functions may be vertebrate-specific or at least
specific to ciliary photoreceptors.

FUTURE EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES NEEDED:

1. ORTHOLOG IDENTIFICATION:
   - Systematic identification of SPATA7 orthologs across vertebrates
   - Phylogenetic analysis
   - Synteny analysis

2. FUNCTIONAL CONSERVATION:
   - Rescue experiments (e.g., human SPATA7 rescuing zebrafish mutants)
   - Comparative protein interaction studies
   - Domain swapping experiments

3. STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION:
   - AlphaFold predictions across orthologs
   - Conserved interaction interfaces
   - Evolution of DCC-specific functions

4. EXPRESSION PATTERN EVOLUTION:
   - Comparative expression studies
   - Retina vs testis expression across species
   - Developmental timing of expression

CONCLUSION:
SPATA7 appears to be a vertebrate protein essential for specialized
photoreceptor cilium function. Its interactions with highly conserved
ciliopathy proteins suggest ancient ciliary functions adapted for the
specialized demands of photoreceptor outer segment maintenance. Detailed
evolutionary studies would provide insights into the specialization of
photoreceptor cilia and the evolution of vertebrate vision.
