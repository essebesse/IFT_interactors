================================================================================
2. KNOWN CILIARY ROLE AND FUNCTION
================================================================================

Primary Function:
CFAP144 is a microtubule inner protein (MIP) that occupies the lumen of ciliary
outer doublet microtubules. It is a structural component required for motile
cilia beating and flagellated sperm motility.

Structural Role in Doublet Microtubules:
- Functions as a connector protein linking filamentous MIPs CFAP45 and CFAP210
- Specifically localized to protofilaments B07 and B08 of the B tubule
- Part of the rich meshwork of proteins in the microtubule lumen (previously
  thought to be hollow)
- Contributes to structural integrity of dynein-decorated doublet microtubules

SNYG Module:
CFAP144 contains a SNYG module, an evolutionarily conserved microtubule-binding
module identified through computational analyses and structure predictions. The
SNYG module consists of:
- Two alpha-helices
- One helix representing a conserved Mn repeat-like motif with highly conserved
  glycine
- SNYG motif-associated helix that contacts the microtubule inner tubulin
  surface
- This module evolved specifically to bind tubulin heterodimers

The SNYG module structure has been experimentally determined for FAM183A along
with other MIPs including PIERCE1, PIERCE2, TEX49, C5ORF49 (CFAP90), and
ATP6V1FNB (SPMIP1).

Molecular Activities:
- Microtubule binding activity (GO:0008017)
- Predicted to be involved in flagellated sperm motility (GO:0097722)
- Predicted to be active in ciliary base (GO:0097546)

DOI: 10.1038/s41467-024-46737-3

This landmark 2024 study systematically identified conserved microtubule-binding
modules (NWE, SNYG, ELLEn, PYG, GFG-repeat) across MIPs and demonstrated that
FAM183A occupies the lumen of cilia outer doublets in human airway epithelial
cells.

================================================================================
3. CILIARY LOCALIZATION
================================================================================

Subcellular Location:
- Axonemal microtubule (GO:0097545)
- Ciliary base (predicted)
- Lumen of ciliary outer doublet microtubules

Specific Localization Details:
- Located within the B tubule of outer doublet microtubules
- Protofilaments B07 and B08
- Serves as a bridging protein between CFAP45 and CFAP210 in the microtubule
  lumen

Motile vs Primary Cilia:
CFAP144 is primarily associated with MOTILE CILIA and FLAGELLA:
- Respiratory ciliated epithelium (bronchus)
- Ependymal cells lining brain ventricles
- Sperm flagella
- Ciliated cells of fallopian tube

Tissue Expression (Human Protein Atlas):
- Testis: Seminiferous ducts (cytoplasmic expression)
- Respiratory system: Ciliated cells of bronchus
- Reproductive tract: Ciliated cells of fallopian tube
- Brain: Expressed in hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and medulla oblongata

The expression pattern indicates CFAP144 is predominantly found in tissues with
motile cilia/flagella rather than primary (non-motile) cilia.

================================================================================
4. KNOWN PROTEIN INTERACTIONS
================================================================================

Experimentally Validated Interactions:
1. CFAP45 - Filamentous microtubule inner protein
   - FAM183A connects CFAP45 to CFAP210 on protofilaments B07 and B08

2. CFAP210 - Filamentous microtubule inner protein
   - FAM183A serves as a bridging/connecting protein

Predicted Interaction (This Study):
3. IFT25 - Intraflagellar transport complex B component
   - ipSAE score: 0.653 (Medium confidence)
   - IFT25 is a phosphoprotein component of IFT-B complex
   - IFT25 binds IFT27 and is involved in cargo transport
   - No direct experimental validation in literature

Other CFAP Proteins:
While CFAP144 is part of the broader CFAP protein family involved in ciliary
structure and function, specific interactions with other CFAPs or axonemal
components (outer dynein arms, radial spokes, etc.) have not been reported in
the literature.

Distinction from Axonemal Surface Complexes:
CFAP144 is a MICROTUBULE INNER PROTEIN (MIP), meaning it is located WITHIN the
lumen of doublet microtubules. It is NOT a component of:
- Outer dynein arms (ODA)
- Inner dynein arms (IDA)
- Radial spokes (RS)
- Nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC)
- Central pair apparatus

These external structures are attached to the outer surface of doublet
microtubules, whereas CFAP144 functions internally to provide structural support.

5. DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS
================================================================================

5.1 Autosomal Recessive Intellectual Disability (ARID)

Key Publication:
Harripaul R, et al. (2018) Identification of candidate gene FAM183A and novel
pathogenic variants in known genes: High genetic heterogeneity for autosomal
recessive intellectual disability. PLoS One 13(11):e0208324.
PMID: 30500859
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0208324

Genetic Finding:
- Nonsense variant: c.377G>A (p.W126*)
- Mutation type: Premature stop codon at amino acid position 126 (out of 134)
- This truncates ~6% of the protein (9 amino acids from C-terminus)
- Inheritance: Autosomal recessive

Clinical Phenotype (Family MR25):
Two affected siblings (MR25-II:1 and MR25-II:2) homozygous for the variant:
- Intellectual disability (ID)
- Microcephaly
- Low-set ears
- Additional correlating phenotypic features

Segregation Analysis:
- Variant segregated in autosomal recessive fashion within the family
- Both parents presumed to be heterozygous carriers (unaffected)

Functional Evidence:
- FAM183A is expressed in human brain regions:
  * Hippocampus
  * Caudate nucleus
  * Medulla oblongata
- Brain expression supports potential role in neurodevelopment
- Ependymal cilia (motile cilia in brain ventricles) may be affected

DECIPHER Database Evidence:
Three out of five FAM183A variants in DECIPHER database are found in patients
with intellectual disability, developmental delay, or microcephaly, though
pathogenicity of these variants is not fully established.

Study Conclusion:
FAM183A is identified as a PROMISING NOVEL CANDIDATE GENE for ARID. Authors
recommend additional functional studies to further support its role in ID
pathogenesis.

5.2 Other Disease Associations

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):
According to GeneCards database, CFAP144 is associated with autism spectrum
disorder. However, specific genetic evidence was not found in peer-reviewed
literature during this search.

Renpenning Syndrome 1:
FAM183A is listed as associated with Renpenning Syndrome 1 (X-linked
intellectual disability) in GeneCards, though the mechanistic basis is unclear
given CFAP144's location on chromosome 1.

Estrogen-Receptor Negative Breast Cancer:
Listed in GeneCards database, but no supporting literature found.

5.3 Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)

IMPORTANT: Despite CFAP144's role in motile cilia structure, NO PUBLISHED
EVIDENCE links CFAP144 mutations to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).

PCD is caused by pathogenic variants in >50 genes affecting ciliary structure,
function, and biogenesis. Other CFAP family members ARE associated with PCD or
ciliary dysfunction:
- CFAP43, CFAP44: Male infertility, flagellar defects
- CFAP46, CFAP54, CFAP74, CFAP221: PCD with C1d projection defects
- CFAP53, CFAP61, CFAP52: Male infertility, sperm flagella defects

However, 20-30% of PCD cases lack identifiable genetic causes, suggesting
undiscovered PCD genes may exist. CFAP144 could potentially be identified as a
PCD gene in future studies.

================================================================================
6. PHENOTYPES IN MODEL ORGANISMS
================================================================================

6.1 Mouse (Mus musculus) Knockout Model

Gene: Cfap144 (MGI:1922679)
NCBI Gene: 75429

Phenotype: SURPRISINGLY NORMAL
- Viability: Homozygous knockout mice are VIABLE
- Fertility: Males and females are FERTILE
- Ciliary function: NO DEFECTS indicative of motile ciliary dysfunction
- Respiratory function: Normal (no chronic respiratory infections)
- Hydrocephalus: Absent (normal ependymal cilia function)
- Situs inversus: Not reported (normal nodal cilia function)

Interpretation:
The normal phenotype in Cfap144 knockout mice suggests:
1. Functional redundancy - Another protein may compensate for CFAP144 loss
2. Species-specific requirements - CFAP144 may be more critical in humans
3. Subtle phenotypes - Defects may be present but not detected under standard
   conditions
4. Contextual importance - Function may be revealed under specific stress or
   environmental conditions

This contrasts sharply with other CFAP knockouts:
- Cfap61-/-: Complete male infertility
- Cfap53-/-: Complete male infertility
- Cfap52-/-: Decreased sperm motility, male infertility
- Cfap43/44-/-: Male infertility, sperm flagella defects (but normal
  respiratory cilia)

The viable and fertile phenotype of Cfap144-/- mice is UNUSUAL for a structural
MIP and raises questions about its functional importance versus redundancy.

6.2 Zebrafish (Danio rerio)

Gene: cfap144 (previously fam183a)
ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-111103-1

Predicted localization:
- Cilium
- Cytoskeleton
- Active in ciliary base (predicted)

Orthology: Zebrafish cfap144 is orthologous to human CFAP144

Function: Predicted to be involved in ciliary assembly and motility (based on
human ortholog function)

Specific knockout phenotype information was not found in the literature search.

6.3 Other Model Organisms

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green algae):
- No specific CFAP144 ortholog identified in search results
- Related FAM183 family proteins may be present
- Chlamydomonas is extensively studied for ciliary biology, but CFAP144 has not
  been characterized in this organism

Tetrahymena thermophila (ciliate):
- No specific CFAP144 ortholog reported
- Tetrahymena has extensive ciliary protein characterization, but CFAP144-
  specific studies not found

Note: The evolutionary conservation data (see Section 9) suggests CFAP144 arose
in chordates rather than being present in early diverging ciliated eukaryotes.

================================================================================
7. FLAGELLAR DEFECTS AND SPERM PHENOTYPES
================================================================================

7.1 Predicted Role in Sperm Flagella

Based on:
1. Gene Ontology annotation: "flagellated sperm motility" (GO:0097722)
2. Tissue expression: High expression in testis seminiferous ducts
3. Structural role: Microtubule inner protein in doublet microtubules
4. Ciliary/flagellar protein family membership

FAM183A is predicted to be important for sperm flagellum structure and function,
as flagellar axonemes contain outer doublet microtubules with MIP networks
identical in architecture to motile cilia.

7.2 Mouse Knockout Phenotype: Normal Fertility

Despite predictions, Cfap144-/- male mice are FERTILE with no reported defects
in:
- Sperm motility
- Sperm morphology
- Flagellar ultrastructure (by light microscopy criteria)
- Fertilization ability

This normal phenotype contrasts with other MIP knockouts that cause male
infertility.

7.3 Comparison with Other CFAP Proteins Affecting Sperm

Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Sperm Flagella (MMAF):
Several CFAP proteins cause MMAF syndrome when mutated:
- CFAP43, CFAP44: Severe flagellar defects, male infertility
  (PMID: 29277146, 28552195, 29449551)
- CFAP61: Complete male infertility (PMID: 34792097)
- CFAP53: Male infertility, flagellum biogenesis defects
- CFAP52: Decreased sperm motility, male infertility

CFAP144 has NOT been associated with MMAF or male infertility in humans,
despite its structural role in flagellar doublet microtubules.

7.4 Human Mutations: No Reported Sperm Phenotype

The reported FAM183A mutation (p.W126*) causing intellectual disability was
identified in two siblings, but sperm/fertility phenotypes were not described.
Given that affected individuals had intellectual disability and microcephaly,
fertility assessment may not have been prioritized or reported.

Hypothesis: CFAP144's role in sperm flagella may be:
1. Redundant with other MIPs
2. Not essential for basic motility
3. Important for optimal but not minimal function
4. Species-specific (critical in humans but not mice)

7.5 Respiratory Cilia

Tissue expression confirms FAM183A presence in ciliated cells of the respiratory
epithelium (bronchus). However:
- No reported respiratory phenotypes in human patients
- Cfap144-/- mice show no respiratory ciliary dysfunction
- No association with chronic respiratory infections or mucus clearance defects

This suggests CFAP144's function in respiratory cilia is either:
- Redundant
- Fine-tuning rather than essential
- Important for long-term ciliary maintenance rather than initial function

================================================================================
8. AXONEME STRUCTURE AND LOCALIZATION
================================================================================

8.1 Axoneme Architecture Overview

The 9+2 axoneme consists of:
- 9 outer doublet microtubules (DMTs) arranged in a circle
- 2 central pair microtubules (not always present)
- Multiple protein complexes decorating the doublets:
  * Outer dynein arms (ODA) - motor proteins for ciliary beating
  * Inner dynein arms (IDA) - motor proteins for waveform regulation
  * Radial spokes (RS) - signal transduction from central apparatus
  * Nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) - linking adjacent doublets
  * Microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) - internal structural proteins

8.2 CFAP144 as a Microtubule Inner Protein (MIP)

CFAP144 belongs to the MIP category:
- Located INSIDE the microtubule lumen (previously thought to be hollow)
- Distinct from outer surface-attached complexes (dyneins, spokes, nexin)
- Part of a recently discovered meshwork of internal structural proteins

Discovery Context:
Until recently, microtubule cores were thought to be hollow. Advanced cryo-EM
and mass spectrometry revealed that cilia/flagella doublet microtubules contain
a rich network of MIPs that stabilize the doublet architecture and may regulate
associated motor proteins.

8.3 Specific Localization in Doublet Microtubules

Doublet Structure:
Each outer doublet consists of:
- A-tubule: Complete microtubule (13 protofilaments, A01-A13)
- B-tubule: Incomplete microtubule (10 protofilaments, B01-B10) fused to
  A-tubule

CFAP144/FAM183A Localization:
- B-tubule lumen
- Protofilaments B07 and B08
- Connects filamentous MIPs CFAP45 and CFAP210

This specific positioning suggests CFAP144 has a specialized structural role in
the B-tubule, which is unique to doublet microtubules (not found in cytoplasmic
microtubules).

8.4 NOT a Component of Canonical Axonemal Complexes

CFAP144 is NOT part of:

Outer Dynein Arms (ODA):
- Heavy chains (DNAH5, DNAH9, DNAH11)
- Intermediate chains (DNAI1, DNAI2)
- Light chains
- Docking complex (ODA-DC: CCDC114, CCDC151, ARMC4)

Inner Dynein Arms (IDA):
- I1/f dynein complex
- Other IDAs (a-g)

Radial Spokes (RS):
- RS head (RSH)
- RS stalk
- RS base

Central Pair Apparatus:
- C1 microtubule projections
- C2 microtubule projections

Nexin-Dynein Regulatory Complex (N-DRC):
- Linker proteins between adjacent doublets

CFAP144's internal location distinguishes it from these external regulatory and
motor complexes.

8.5 Interaction with Tubulin and Other MIPs

SNYG Module-Tubulin Interaction:
The SNYG module in CFAP144 directly contacts the inner surface of tubulin
heterodimers in the microtubule wall. This provides structural stability to the
doublet microtubule from within.

MIP-MIP Interactions:
CFAP144 bridges two filamentous MIPs:
- CFAP45 (Cilia and Flagella Associated Protein 45)
- CFAP210 (Cilia and Flagella Associated Protein 210)

This suggests CFAP144 functions as a connector/adapter protein within the MIP
network, linking longitudinally oriented filamentous proteins.

8.6 Evolutionary Context of MIPs

MIPs are evolutionarily conserved features of motile cilia and flagella. The
SNYG module found in CFAP144 is one of several conserved microtubule-binding
modules (including NWE, ELLEn, PYG, GFG-repeat) that have been identified
across diverse ciliated organisms.

These modules evolved specifically to stabilize the unique architecture of
doublet microtubules, which are distinct from cytoplasmic microtubules in:
- Structure (incomplete B-tubule)
- Stability (long-lived, post-translationally modified)
- Function (support motility machinery)

CFAP144's role as a structural MIP positions it as part of the fundamental
architectural framework of motile cilia and flagella.

================================================================================
9. EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION
================================================================================

9.1 Conservation Across Species

Human (Homo sapiens):
- CFAP144 / FAM183A
- Chromosome 1p36
- 134 amino acids
- UniProt: A6NL82

Mouse (Mus musculus):
- Cfap144
- Chromosome 3
- NCBI Gene: 75429
- MGI: 1922679
- High sequence similarity to human ortholog

Rat (Rattus norvegicus):
- Cfap144
- RGD: 1561932
- Orthologous to human CFAP144

Zebrafish (Danio rerio):
- cfap144 (previously fam183a)
- ZFIN: ZDB-GENE-111103-1
- Orthologous to human CFAP144
- Predicted ciliary localization

Other Vertebrates:
- Tiger (Panthera tigris): CFAP144 gene identified (NCBI Gene: 102948797)
- Conservation across vertebrates suggests important chordate-specific function

9.2 Evolutionary Origin

Phylogenetic Distribution:
Based on search results, CFAP144 appears to have arisen during chordate
evolution rather than being present in early diverging ciliated eukaryotes.

FAM183 Family:
The broader FAM183 family (which includes FAM183A/CFAP144 and FAM183B) shows:
- FAM183B: Conserved from green algae (Chlamydomonas) to humans
- FAM183A (CFAP144): Present in chordates, unclear if present in protists

Fam183b Study:
A 2018 Scientific Reports paper examined Fam183b (related gene):
- Identified as FOXJ1 target gene (motile cilia transcription factor)
- Conserved sequence from Xenopus to mammals
- Essential for motile cilia in Xenopus embryos
- Surprisingly DISPENSABLE for ciliary function in mice (Fam183b-/- mice have
  normal cilia)

This pattern of evolutionary conservation with variable functional requirement
across species is similar to what is observed for CFAP144.

9.3 Conservation in Non-Chordate Ciliated Organisms

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green algae):
- Specific CFAP144 ortholog: NOT IDENTIFIED in search results
- FAM183 family members may be present
- Chlamydomonas has extensive characterized ciliary proteome, but CFAP144 not
  reported

Tetrahymena thermophila (ciliate):
- Specific CFAP144 ortholog: NOT REPORTED
- Tetrahymena has RIB72A and RIB72B as characterized MIPs
- Other MIPs characterized, but CFAP144 ortholog not identified

Trypanosoma (protozoan parasite):
- No CFAP144 ortholog mentioned
- Other CFAPs (CFAP43, CFAP44) have been studied in Trypanosoma

9.4 Implications of Conservation Pattern

The apparent chordate-specific evolution of CFAP144 suggests:

1. Late evolutionary innovation: CFAP144 may be a more recent addition to the
   MIP repertoire, specific to vertebrate/chordate lineages

2. Specialized function: May serve functions specific to vertebrate motile cilia
   (respiratory, ependymal, reproductive) rather than universal ciliary roles

3. Redundancy in vertebrates: Even within chordates, CFAP144 function appears
   redundant in mice but essential in humans (intellectual disability phenotype)

4. Dispensability in protists: Single-celled ciliated organisms (Chlamydomonas,
   Tetrahymena, Paramecium) may not require CFAP144, relying on more ancient
   MIP systems

5. FOXJ1 regulation: If CFAP144 is a FOXJ1 target (like FAM183B), it may be
   part of a vertebrate-specific transcriptional program for motile
   ciliogenesis

9.5 Sequence Conservation and Functional Domains

SNYG Module Conservation:
The SNYG module identified in FAM183A represents an evolutionarily conserved
microtubule-binding module found across multiple MIPs. While the module itself
is ancient, FAM183A/CFAP144 appears to be a chordate-specific protein
containing this module.

Other MIPs with SNYG modules include:
- TEX49 (SPMIP11)
- ATP6V1FNB (SPMIP1)
- C5ORF49 (CFAP90)
- C20ORF85
- C2ORF50

Comparative analysis across vertebrates would reveal:
- Which regions of CFAP144 are most conserved (likely SNYG module)
- Which regions are variable (likely regulatory regions)
- Whether pseudogenes exist (CFAP144P1 pseudogene exists on human genome)

9.6 Functional Conservation vs Sequence Conservation

Key Observation:
Sequence conservation does not always predict functional requirement:
- Mouse Cfap144 is orthologous to human CFAP144 (sequence conserved)
- BUT mouse Cfap144-/- mice are viable and fertile (function dispensable)
- WHILE human FAM183A mutations cause intellectual disability (function
  essential)

This discordance suggests:
1. Species-specific genetic compensation mechanisms
2. Different developmental requirements between rodents and primates
3. Polygenic buffering in mice vs humans
4. Environmental/lifestyle differences affecting ciliary requirements

Similar patterns observed in other ciliary genes:
- Some PCD genes cause severe disease in humans but mild/no phenotype in mice
- Nodal flow genes show variable penetrance across species
- Sperm flagellar genes may have different essentiality

9.7 SNYG Module: Ancient Building Block in New Proteins

The SNYG module represents an ancient microtubule-binding domain that has been
incorporated into multiple different MIPs across evolution. The 2024 Nature
Communications study identified this as one of several conserved "themes" or
building blocks used to construct the MIP network.

Evolutionary Model:
1. Ancient origin: SNYG module evolved early as tubulin-binding domain
2. Modular usage: Different proteins incorporated SNYG modules via domain
   shuffling
3. Species-specific proteins: CFAP144 represents a chordate-specific protein
   utilizing the ancient SNYG module
4. Functional diversification: Different SNYG-containing proteins have
   specialized roles in different doublet positions

This modular evolutionary strategy explains why:
- The SNYG module itself is conserved across distant species
- But specific SNYG-containing proteins (like CFAP144) are lineage-specific
- Functional redundancy exists due to multiple SNYG-containing proteins

================================================================================
10. IFT25 CONNECTION AND POTENTIAL CARGO RELATIONSHIP
================================================================================

10.1 This Study's Finding

AlphaFold3 Prediction:
- CFAP144 ↔ IFT25 interaction predicted
- ipSAE score: 0.653 (MEDIUM confidence)
- Confidence classification: ipSAE 0.5-0.7 = Medium confidence
- Analysis version: v4 (ipSAE scoring)

Interpretation:
The ipSAE score of 0.653 suggests a potential interaction with moderate
structural confidence. This places it in the medium confidence range, indicating:
- Possible functional interaction
- May be biologically relevant
- Requires experimental validation
- Could be context-dependent or transient

10.2 IFT25 Background

IFT25 Identity:
- Component of Intraflagellar Transport Complex B (IFT-B)
- Small GTPase-like protein (though lacks GTPase activity)
- Forms heterodimer with IFT27
- Involved in cargo transport along cilia

IFT-B Complex:
IFT-B is responsible for anterograde (base-to-tip) transport in cilia:
- Core IFT-B: IFT88, IFT81, IFT74, IFT70, IFT56, IFT52, IFT46, IFT27, IFT25
- IFT-B binds kinesin-2 motors for anterograde movement
- Carries structural and signaling protein cargoes into cilia

IFT25 Specific Functions:
- Physically interacts with IFT27 (Rab-like GTPase)
- IFT25-IFT27 heterodimer mediates BBSome docking to IFT-B complex
- Required for Hedgehog signaling component transport (SMO, PTCH1)
- Involved in ciliary membrane protein export
- Links signal-dependent movement to IFT machinery

Key References:
- PMID: 19416843 - IFT25 is phosphoprotein component of IFT-B, interacts with
  IFT27 in Chlamydomonas

  flagellogenesis

10.3 Potential CFAP144-IFT25 Interaction Scenarios

Scenario 1: CFAP144 as IFT Cargo
Hypothesis: IFT25 (via IFT-B complex) transports CFAP144 into cilia for
assembly into doublet microtubules.

Evidence supporting:
- CFAP144 is a structural MIP that must be delivered into cilia
- IFT-B transports axonemal precursor proteins
- IFT25-IFT27 heterodimer serves as cargo adaptor
- Many MIPs require IFT for ciliary entry

Evidence against:
- No literature documenting CFAP144 as IFT cargo
- Cfap144-/- mice have normal cilia (suggesting assembly doesn't require it)
- Other MIP cargo relationships not well-characterized

Scenario 2: Transient Assembly Interaction
Hypothesis: CFAP144 interacts with IFT25 during ciliary assembly or MIP
integration into doublet microtubules.

Evidence supporting:
- ipSAE score suggests structural interaction capability
- Assembly of MIP network may require coordination with IFT machinery
- Transient interactions would be biologically relevant even if not stable

Evidence against:
- No experimental evidence for IFT involvement in MIP assembly
- MIP assembly mechanisms are poorly understood
- AlphaFold predicts static structures, not assembly intermediates

Scenario 3: Regulatory Interaction
Hypothesis: CFAP144 may interact with IFT25 to regulate IFT complex function or
cargo loading.

Evidence supporting:
- IFT25-IFT27 is a cargo adaptor that must be regulated
- MIPs could potentially regulate IFT from within the axoneme
- Structural proteins sometimes have regulatory functions

Evidence against:
- MIPs are structural, not typically regulatory
- IFT regulation occurs primarily via kinases/phosphatases
- No precedent for MIP-IFT regulatory interactions

Scenario 4: False Positive Prediction
Hypothesis: The predicted interaction is not biologically real.

Evidence supporting:
- Medium confidence (0.653) allows for false positives
- No literature support for CFAP144-IFT25 interaction
- Mouse knockout shows normal cilia (wouldn't expect if essential IFT cargo)
- AlphaFold can predict structurally compatible but non-occurring interactions

Evidence against:
- ipSAE 0.653 is above random chance
- AlphaFold3 has improved specificity for true interactions
- Absence of literature evidence doesn't mean interaction is false

10.4 IFT-B1 vs IFT-B2 Subcomplexes

IFT-B architecture:
- IFT-B1: IFT88, IFT70, IFT52, IFT46 (core stability)
- IFT-B2: IFT81, IFT74, IFT27, IFT25, IFT22, IFT80 (cargo binding)

IFT25 is part of IFT-B2 subcomplex (peripheral), specifically the IFT25-IFT27
heterodimer that projects from the main IFT-B structure.

This peripheral position makes IFT25-IFT27 an ideal cargo adaptor, as it can:
- Interact with diverse cargo proteins
- Be regulated independently of core IFT-B
- Mediate specific cargo loading (e.g., BBSome, Hedgehog components)

If CFAP144 is an IFT cargo, interaction with IFT25 (peripheral IFT-B2) would be
mechanistically appropriate.

10.5 Experimental Validation Needed

To validate CFAP144-IFT25 interaction:

Biochemical Approaches:
1. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) from ciliated cells
2. Pull-down assays with recombinant proteins
3. Size exclusion chromatography to detect complex formation
4. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for binding kinetics

Cell Biology Approaches:
1. Co-localization in cilia by super-resolution microscopy
2. FRET or BiFC to detect interaction in living cells
3. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) in situ
4. IFT tracking experiments to see if CFAP144 moves with IFT trains

Functional Approaches:
1. Test if IFT25 knockdown affects CFAP144 ciliary localization
2. Examine CFAP144 localization in IFT25-/- cells
3. Test if CFAP144 affects IFT velocity or cargo loading
4. Examine genetic interactions in model organisms

Structural Approaches:
1. Cryo-EM of CFAP144-IFT25 complex
2. X-ray crystallography of interaction domains
3. Crosslinking mass spectrometry to map interface
4. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange to identify binding surfaces

10.6 Broader Context: MIPs and IFT

Open Questions in the Field:
- How are MIPs transported into cilia?
- Do MIPs use IFT for ciliary entry?
- Are MIPs assembled in the cytoplasm or within cilia?
- What regulates MIP incorporation into doublet microtubules?

If CFAP144-IFT25 interaction is real, it could provide insights into MIP
transport mechanisms more broadly, as CFAP144 might serve as a model MIP cargo.

10.7 Comparison with Known IFT Cargoes

Known IFT-B Cargoes:
- Outer/inner dynein arm components
- Radial spoke proteins
- Central pair proteins
- Tubulin (for axoneme extension)
- Signaling proteins (SMO, PTCH1, GPR161)
- BBSome complex (via IFT25-IFT27)

MIPs as IFT Cargoes:
- Limited literature on MIP transport
- Most studies focus on outer axonemal complexes
- MIP assembly is an emerging area of research

If CFAP144 is confirmed as IFT25 cargo, it would:
- Expand known cargo repertoire to include MIPs
- Provide mechanism for MIP ciliary entry
- Suggest IFT25-IFT27 has broader cargo specificity than currently recognized

10.8 Clinical Relevance of CFAP144-IFT25 Interaction

If Interaction is Real:
- IFT25 mutations could phenocopy CFAP144 deficiency by preventing cargo
  delivery
- CFAP144 mutations might impair IFT function beyond just MIP deficiency
- Combination of IFT25 and CFAP144 variants could show genetic interaction
- Therapeutic strategies targeting IFT could affect CFAP144-dependent processes

Current Knowledge:
- IFT25 mutations have not been reported to cause human disease (surprisingly)
- CFAP144 mutations cause intellectual disability
- The connection (if real) could explain neurodevelopmental aspects, as
  ependymal cilia require both IFT and MIP function

10.9 Summary: IFT25 Connection

Status: PREDICTED BUT UNVALIDATED
Confidence: Medium (ipSAE = 0.653)
Most Likely Scenario: CFAP144 as cargo of IFT25-containing IFT-B complex
Evidence Needed: Biochemical validation, localization studies, functional tests

The predicted CFAP144-IFT25 interaction is plausible given:
- IFT-B transports structural proteins
- IFT25-IFT27 serves as cargo adaptor
- CFAP144 must be delivered into cilia for MIP assembly

However, medium confidence score and lack of literature support require
experimental validation before drawing strong conclusions.

This prediction could open new research directions into MIP transport mechanisms
and expand understanding of IFT cargo diversity.

================================================================================
14. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

CFAP144 (also known as FAM183A) is a 134-amino acid microtubule inner protein
(MIP) that localizes to the lumen of ciliary doublet microtubules in motile
cilia and flagella. It contains an evolutionarily conserved SNYG module that
binds the inner surface of tubulin heterodimers and serves as a structural
connector between filamentous MIPs CFAP45 and CFAP210 on protofilaments B07-B08
of the B-tubule.

CFAP144 exhibits an intriguing pattern of evolutionary conservation and
functional requirement: while present across vertebrates and predicted to be
important for sperm flagella and motile cilia function, Cfap144 knockout mice
are surprisingly viable and fertile with no apparent ciliary defects. This
contrasts sharply with human genetics, where a nonsense mutation (p.W126*)
causes autosomal recessive intellectual disability with microcephaly,
establishing FAM183A as a candidate gene for neurodevelopmental disorders.

The tissue expression pattern—restricted to ciliated epithelia (respiratory,
fallopian tube), testis, and brain—supports roles in motile cilia function and
neurodevelopment. The brain expression, particularly in hippocampus and other
regions, may explain the intellectual disability phenotype, potentially through
ependymal cilia dysfunction affecting cerebrospinal fluid flow or through
currently unknown non-ciliary neuronal functions.

The predicted interaction with IFT25 (ipSAE = 0.653, medium confidence)
suggests CFAP144 may be transported into cilia by the intraflagellar transport
machinery, specifically via the IFT25-IFT27 cargo adaptor heterodimer within
IFT complex B. However, this interaction remains experimentally unvalidated and
requires biochemical confirmation. If verified, it would provide important
insights into MIP transport mechanisms and expand the known cargo repertoire of
IFT25.

Despite its structural role in doublet microtubules, CFAP144 is NOT a component
of outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, radial spokes, or the nexin-dynein
regulatory complex. Instead, it occupies a specialized niche within the
microtubule lumen, representing a more recently appreciated category of ciliary
structural proteins.

Key unresolved questions include: (1) Why is CFAP144 dispensable in mice but
essential in humans? (2) What is the molecular mechanism linking CFAP144 loss
to intellectual disability? (3) Is CFAP144 truly an IFT cargo, and if so, how
is its delivery regulated? (4) Are there additional disease-causing mutations
in CFAP144 waiting to be discovered in unsolved intellectual disability or
ciliopathy cases?

CFAP144 represents an emerging area of ciliary biology where structural
microtubule inner proteins intersect with neurodevelopmental disease,
highlighting that even proteins with seemingly redundant functions in model
organisms can be critical for human brain development. Future structural
biology, cell biology, and clinical genetics studies will be needed to fully
elucidate CFAP144's roles in ciliary structure, intraflagellar transport,
and neurodevelopment.
