Cerebral Cavernous Malformation 3 Protein
Vascular Integrity & Endothelial Barrier Function

Predicted Interaction: PDCD10 (ipSAE=0.562) ↔ BBS1 (BBSome/Bardet-Biedl Syndrome)
Report Generated: 2025-11-17

================================================================================
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

PDCD10, also known as Cerebral Cavernous Malformation 3 (CCM3), is a critical
regulator of vascular integrity and endothelial barrier function. Mutations in
PDCD10 cause cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), a disease affecting 0.1-0.5%
of the human population characterized by low-flow, hemorrhagic vascular lesions
in the brain that can lead to stroke-like symptoms, seizures, and cognitive
decline. PDCD10 functions as a core component of the CCM signaling complex (CSC),
forming trimeric complexes with CCM1/KRIT1 and CCM2 to stabilize endothelial
cell-cell junctions and regulate angiogenesis through VEGFR2 signaling.

The predicted interaction with BBS1 (ipSAE=0.562, medium confidence) represents
a potentially novel connection between vascular integrity mechanisms and ciliary
transport machinery, specifically through the BBSome complex involved in
Bardet-Biedl syndrome pathophysiology.

3.1 Overall Structure and Domains

PDCD10 is an all α-helical protein composed of 212 amino acids organized into
9 α-helices (αA-αI) arranged into two functionally distinct domains:

Domain 1 - N-Terminal Dimerization Domain (residues ~1-70):
  • Composed of 4 α-helices (αA-αD)
  • Mediates PDCD10 homodimerization
  • Enables heterodimerization with GCKIII kinases (STK24, STK25, MST4)
  • Contains hinge region (Lys69-Lys70) allowing ~25° domain orientation variation

Domain 2 - C-Terminal FAT-Homology Domain (residues ~100-212):
  • Composed of 4 α-helices (αF-αI)
  • FAT = Focal Adhesion Targeting domain
  • Mediates direct interaction with CCM2's phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain
  • Contains hydrophobic interaction surfaces

  • Cytoplasmic structures - diffuse localization in cytoplasm

Localization Significance:
  • Junction localization: stabilizes adherens junctions
  • Focal adhesion localization: links to cytoskeletal remodeling

V. BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

5.1 Endothelial Barrier Function and Vascular Integrity

PDCD10's primary role is to maintain the blood-brain barrier and vascular
integrity through multiple mechanisms:

Mechanism 1 - VE-Cadherin Stabilization:
  • PDCD10 stabilizes VE-cadherin (vascular endothelial cadherin)
  • VE-cadherin forms the core of adherens junctions between endothelial cells
  • Prevents internalization and degradation of VE-cadherin
  • Maintains cell-cell adhesion strength

  Functional Consequence:
    - Low PDCD10 → VE-cadherin internalization → junction loss →
      increased vascular permeability

Mechanism 2 - Tight Junction Complex Organization:
  • PDCD10 regulates assembly of tight junction proteins
  • Coordinates claudins, occludin, and JAM-C localization
  • Maintains brain endothelial barrier-specific junction composition

Mechanism 3 - Rho Kinase Inhibition:
  • PDCD10 protein suppresses endothelial stress fibers
  • Inhibits Rho kinase (Rock) activity
  • Reduces vascular permeability

  Pathway: PDCD10 → Suppresses Rho → Decreases Rock → Stabilizes junctions

Mechanism 4 - ERK1/2-Cortactin Signaling:
  • PDCD10 regulates ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activity
  • Controls cortactin function in junction assembly
  • Cross-talk between PDCD10 and ERK1/2 pathways

5.2 VEGFR2 Signaling and Angiogenesis Regulation

PDCD10 plays critical roles in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling, which controls angiogenesis:

VEGFR2 Stabilization Mechanism:
  • In response to VEGF ligand stimulation, PDCD10 is recruited to VEGFR2
  • PDCD10 stabilizes VEGFR2 kinase domain
  • Prevents VEGFR2 internalization and degradation
  • Maintains sustained VEGFR2 signaling

  Molecular Details:
    - PDCD10 binding prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation
    - Stabilizes VEGFR2 at plasma membrane
    - Enhances kinase autophosphorylation
    - Prolongs VEGF signaling cascade

Downstream Signaling Consequences:
  • VEGFR2 → phosphorylation of PLCγ (phospholipase C gamma)
  • PLCγ → IP3 production → Ca²⁺ mobilization
  • VEGFR2 → PI3K/AKT pathway activation
  • PI3K/AKT → eNOS activation → nitric oxide production → vasodilation

Angiogenesis Regulation:
  • Proper VEGFR2 signaling required for:
    - Endothelial cell migration
    - Vascular sprouting
    - Vessel maturation
    - Proper vascular network formation

  PDCD10 Loss Consequences:
    - Reduced VEGFR2 signaling
    - Defective angiogenesis
    - Impaired vascular development
    - Embryonic lethality (global deletion)

5.3 GCKIII Kinase Stabilization and Golgi Organization

PDCD10 stabilizes germinal center kinase III (GCKIII) family serine/threonine
kinases:

GCKIII Family Members:
  • STK24 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 24, also called MST4)
  • STK25 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 25, also called YSK1)
  • MST4 (Mammalian STE20-like kinase 4)
  • SOK1 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 3)
  • Mst3 (Mammalian STE20-like kinase 3)

PDCD10-GCKIII Interaction Mechanism:
  • PDCD10 N-terminal domain binds GCKIII C-terminal tail
  • Direct heterodimerization
  • Stabilizes GCKIII protein levels
  • Prevents GCKIII degradation

Functional Consequences - Golgi Assembly:
  • PDCD10 localized to Golgi apparatus
  • PDCD10-GCKIII complex promotes Golgi organization
  • Interaction with GM130 (cis-Golgi matrix protein)
  • Coordinates organelle assembly with kinase signaling

Functional Consequences - Cell Orientation:
  • PDCD10-GCKIII signaling controls cell polarity
  • Affects cell orientation during migration
  • Important for tissue organization
  • Regulates directional cell migration

5.4 Kidney Water Reabsorption (Aquaporin-2 Regulation)

A surprising function of PDCD10 discovered recently:

The PDCD10-GCKIII complex (specifically PDCD10-STK24/STK25) regulates kidney
water reabsorption by controlling aquaporin-2 (AQP2) membrane trafficking:

Mechanism:
  • PDCD10-STK24/25 complex phosphorylates signaling proteins
  • Controls AQP2 membrane targeting in principal cells
  • Regulates water channel insertion at apical membrane
  • Critical for water reabsorption in collecting duct

Pathophysiological Relevance:
  • Explains PDCD10 mutations affecting kidney function
  • Links vascular and renal epithelial integrity
  • Both tissues require endothelial/epithelial barrier function

       regulating Aqp2 membrane targeting - JCI Insight. 2021; 6(14):e142838)
DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.142838

5.5 Apoptosis and Cell Death Regulation

PDCD10 (Programmed Cell Death 10) has complex roles in apoptosis:

Protective Function:
  • PDCD10 enhances cell proliferation in some contexts
  • Protects cells from apoptosis in certain cell types
  • Promotes cell survival in endothelial cells
  • Maintains vascular endothelial cell viability

Context-Dependent Effects:
  • In endothelial cells: pro-survival function
  • In T cells: enhances proliferation and prevents apoptosis
  • In tumor cells: dual roles (context-specific)
  • Mechanism: may involve caspase inhibition or survival signaling

VI. CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS (CCM): DISEASE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
================================================================================

6.1 Disease Overview and Epidemiology

Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs):
  • Low-flow, blood-filled vascular lesions in brain/CNS
  • Characterized by abnormal, dilated capillaries
  • Lack normal intervening brain tissue
  • Can hemorrhage spontaneously
  • Prevalence: 0.1-0.5% of human population

Disease Manifestations:
  • Hemorrhagic stroke (sudden focal neurological deficit)
  • Seizures (due to hemosiderin/iron deposition and cortical irritation)
  • Headaches
  • Cognitive decline
  • Focal neurological deficits
  • Mortality risk from hemorrhage

Classification:
  • Familial CCM (inherited, multiple mutations)
  • Sporadic CCM (single somatic mutation)
  • Germline mutations in CCM1, CCM2, or CCM3 genes

6.2 PDCD10/CCM3-Associated Disease

CCM3 represents ~5-10% of familial CCM cases.

OMIM Entry: *609118
Gene: PDCD10 (Chromosome 3q26)
Inheritance: Autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance
Mutation Spectrum: Frameshift, nonsense, splicing mutations, deletions

Unique Features of CCM3:

  AGGRESSIVE PHENOTYPE:
    • Earlier disease onset (often childhood vs. adulthood in CCM1/2)
    • Higher lesion burden
    • More frequent hemorrhages
    • Worse clinical outcomes
    • Higher seizure frequency

    Clinical Comparison:
      CCM1 (KRIT1): Moderate severity, variable penetrance
      CCM2 (CCM2): Moderate severity
      CCM3 (PDCD10): More severe, earlier onset, frequent hemorrhages

  PENETRANCE AND EXPRESSIVITY:
    • Incomplete penetrance in families
    • Variable expressivity (some family members symptomatic, others asymptomatic)
    • Pdcd10 heterozygous mice have greater lesion burden than other Ccm genotypes
    • Suggests dose-sensitive threshold

Mutation Examples:

Case 1: Frameshift Mutation (2024-2025 Publications)
  • Novel frameshift mutation identified in pediatric patient
  • Causes reduced mRNA expression
  • Results in truncated protein lacking FAT domain
  • Severe clinical phenotype with multiple lesions
  PMID: 36723700

  • Complete loss of protein function
  • 140-patient CCM cohort study identified 28 pathogenic variants
  PMID: 30161288 (A single-center study on 140 patients with cerebral cavernous
         malformations: 28 new pathogenic variants and functional characterization

  DOI: 10.1038/s41431-018-0160-2

6.3 Pathophysiological Mechanism: How PDCD10 Mutations Cause CCM

Normal PDCD10 Function → Vascular Homeostasis:

  PDCD10 expression ↓ (via mutation/deletion)
    ↓
  CCM signaling complex assembly ↓
    ↓
  VEGFR2 stabilization ↓
    ↓
  Aberrant VEGF signaling (too much, too uncontrolled)
    ↓
  Excessive angiogenesis/vascular sprouting
    ↓
  Weakened endothelial junctions (VE-cadherin loss/internalization)
    ↓
  Increased vascular permeability
    ↓
  Blood extravasation into vessel walls
    ↓
  Cavernoma formation with hemorrhage

  PARALLEL MECHANISM:

  PDCD10 loss ↓
    ↓
  Rho kinase inhibition ↓ (loses suppression of Rock)
    ↓
  Increased Rock activity
    ↓
  Stress fiber formation
    ↓
  Junction destabilization
    ↓
  Vascular defects

Critical Point: DUAL PATHWAY DYSFUNCTION
  • Loss of VEGFR2 stabilization (reduced signaling)
  • Loss of Rho suppression (increased pathological signaling)
  • Combined effects create severe vascular dysfunction

6.4 Molecular Mechanisms in Detail

Mechanism A - VE-Cadherin Destabilization:

Loss of PDCD10 in endothelial cells leads to:
  1. Reduced VE-cadherin expression
  2. Increased VE-cadherin internalization
  3. Lysosomal degradation of VE-cadherin
  4. Loss of adherens junction structural integrity
  5. Opening of paracellular gaps between cells
  6. Unregulated plasma leakage into subendothelial space

Consequence:
  • Red blood cells and plasma proteins escape vessel
  • Hemosiderin deposition from old hemorrhages
  • Iron-related oxidative stress
  • Seizure focus formation (iron irritation)

Mechanism B - Excessive Angiogenic Signaling:

PDCD10 loss leads to:
  1. Loss of VEGFR2 stabilization (paradoxically)
  2. VEGFR2 instability causes compensatory upregulation
  3. Dysregulated VEGF response
  4. Excessive endothelial cell sprouting/migration
  5. Abnormal capillary architecture
  6. Malformed vessel with weak walls

Mechanism C - Endothelial Cell Dysfunction:

PDCD10 loss in endothelial cells:
  • Defective cytoskeletal organization
  • Loss of cell polarity
  • Impaired cell-cell adhesion
  • Loss of mechanotransduction
  • Reduced eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) signaling
  • Loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation

VII. MOUSE MODELS AND PHENOTYPES
================================================================================

7.1 Global PDCD10 Knockout

Ccm3-/- (homozygous null):

  Embryonic Stage: E9.5-E10.5
    • Embryonic lethal
    • Impaired vasculogenesis and angiogenesis
    • Defective heart morphology
    • Abnormal hematopoiesis (blood cell formation)
    • Severely reduced VEGFR2 signaling

  Mechanism of Lethality:
    - Cannot form vascular network
    - Reduced oxygen delivery to developing tissues
    - Heart morphogenesis defects
    - Systemic circulation failure

  Cellular Phenotype:
    • Endothelial cells: reduced VEGFR2 signaling
    • Impaired cell-cell junction formation
    • Reduced vascular sprouting capacity
    • Increased apoptosis

Ccm3+/- (heterozygous):

  Embryonic Development:
    • Generally viable and fertile
    • Normal embryonic development
    • Subtle vascular defects may appear

  Postnatal:
    • Viable and fertile
    • No obvious developmental abnormalities
    • Subtle endothelial dysfunction may occur
    • Greater lesion burden develops with age or injury

PMID: 20371769 (Stabilization of VEGFR2 signaling by cerebral cavernous
       malformation 3 is critical for vascular development - Circulation. 2010;
       121(16):1826-36)
DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.912410

7.2 Conditional Knockout Models

Conditional deletion allows study of postnatal roles:

Endothelial Cell-Specific Deletion (Tie2-Cre; Ccm3flox/flox):

  Early Deletion (before P0):
    • Embryonic lethality (same as global knockout)
    • Vascular development defects
    • Angiogenesis impairment

  Postnatal Deletion (after P0, at P1):
    • Viable
    • Develop cerebellar and retinal lesions
    • Similar phenotype to human CCM disease
    • Progressive cavernoma formation
    • Mimic human disease pathology

  Lesion Characteristics:
    • Abnormally dilated capillaries
    • Lack of proper endothelial tight junctions
    • Hemorrhagic features
    • Progressive lesion growth with age

  Mechanism:
    • Loss of postnatal vascular homeostasis
    • Cannot maintain barrier integrity under normal/stress conditions
    • Lesions develop in highly perfused tissues (brain, retina)
    • Hemosiderin deposition indicates repeated bleeding

Clinical Relevance:
  The postnatal Ccm3 knockout model closely recapitulates human CCM disease,
  suggesting that PDCD10 mutations cause disease through loss of endothelial
  barrier maintenance function in postnatal vessels, not through disrupted
  embryonic vascular development alone.

VIII. THE PDCD10-BBS1 INTERACTION: A POTENTIAL NOVEL CONNECTION
================================================================================

8.1 Predicted Interaction Details

From AlphaFold3 Predictions:
  • Protein 1: PDCD10 (CCM3) - Vascular integrity regulator
  • Protein 2: BBS1 (Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 1) - BBSome component
  • ipSAE Score: 0.562
  • Confidence Level: MEDIUM (0.5-0.7 range)
  • ipSAE Interpretation: Moderate confidence interaction prediction

ipSAE Score Context:

  The ipSAE (interaction prediction Score from Aligned Errors) metric from
  AlphaFold3 evaluates protein-protein interaction confidence by analyzing:
    • Predicted aligned error (PAE) between chains
    • Contact residue pairs with good PAE scores
    • Domain-domain vs. non-functional region interaction quality

  Score Range Interpretation:
    • >0.7: High confidence - likely true interaction
    • 0.5-0.7: MEDIUM confidence - plausible, requires validation
    • <0.5: Low confidence - probably false positive

  PDCD10-BBS1 (0.562): MEDIUM - suggests plausible interaction interface that
  warrants experimental validation but is not high-confidence prediction.

8.3 Endothelial Cilia and the BBSome

Endothelial Primary Cilia:

All endothelial cells (and most mammalian cells) bear single primary cilia:

  Structural Features:
    • Single, non-motile cilium (unlike nodal cilia which beat)
    • Projects from cell body
    • 9+0 microtubular architecture (vs. 9+2 of motile cilia)
    • Contains basal body and transition zone

  Function in Endothelial Cells:
    • Mechanosensing of blood flow/shear stress
    • Calcium signaling in response to flow
    • Regulation of VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling
    • Control of vascular permeability
    • Angiogenesis regulation
    • Vascular inflammation modulation

BBSome Role in Endothelial Cilia:

The BBSome is essential for:
  • Trafficking cargo to endothelial ciliary membrane
  • Maintaining ciliary protein composition
  • Proper GPCR signaling in cilia
  • Calcium channel localization to cilia

Functional Consequences of BBSome Loss in Endothelial Cells:

  Bbs1-/- Endothelial Cells (from conditional knockout studies):
    • Impaired acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation
    • Vascular dysfunction in aorta and mesenteric arteries
    • Altered endothelial-dependent vasodilation
    • Impaired VEGF signaling

  Proposed Mechanisms:
    • Loss of ciliary mechanosensing
    • Defective NO production (endothelial NO synthase)
    • Altered calcium signaling
    • Impaired VEGFR2 trafficking/signaling
    • Compromised endothelial barrier function

8.4 Potential Mechanistic Link Between PDCD10 and BBS1

Hypothesis: PDCD10-BBS1 Interaction in Endothelial Cilia and Barrier Integrity

The predicted PDCD10-BBS1 interaction (ipSAE=0.562) may represent a novel
connection between:

  PATHWAY A - CCM Signaling (PDCD10):
    • Maintains vascular endothelial barrier integrity
    • Stabilizes VEGFR2 signaling
    • Regulates VE-cadherin junctions
    • Controls Rho/Rock signaling

  PATHWAY B - Ciliary Transport (BBS1/BBSome):
    • Facilitates protein trafficking to cilia
    • Enables mechanosensing of shear stress
    • Regulates ciliary calcium signaling
    • Maintains ciliary GPCR function

Speculative Interaction Mechanism:

If PDCD10 and BBS1 physically interact, potential functions might include:

1. Ciliary VEGFR2 Signaling Coordination:
   • PDCD10 might stabilize VEGFR2 both at plasma membrane AND ciliary membrane
   • BBS1/BBSome might traffic VEGFR2 to endothelial cilia
   • Combined function: enhance VEGF signaling through ciliary compartment
   • Relevance: cilia are signaling centers; VEGFR2 activation in cilia may
     regulate mechanosensing and vascular permeability

2. Ciliary Shear Stress Sensing:
   • PDCD10 might coordinate with BBSome-dependent ciliary mechanosensing
   • Ciliary deflection by blood flow → BBSome-dependent calcium influx
   • PDCD10 might stabilize calcium signaling proteins in cilia
   • Result: enhanced endothelial response to shear stress

3. Barrier Integrity at Tight Junctions:
   • BBSome might traffic junction proteins (claudins, occludin) through cilia
   • PDCD10 at junctions might recruit ciliary transport machinery
   • Could represent junction organization/assembly pathway

4. Angiogenesis Coordination:
   • BBSome trafficking to cilia enables VEGF sensing
   • PDCD10 stabilizes VEGFR2 intracellular signaling
   • Coordinated ciliary-junction signaling for vascular sprouting

Caveats and Limitations:

  • ipSAE score of 0.562 indicates MEDIUM confidence
  • Interaction must be experimentally validated
  • No published data directly linking PDCD10 and BBS1
  • Functional significance (if real) remains unknown
  • Both proteins expressed in endothelial cells (permissive for interaction)
  • Both relevant to vascular integrity (compatible mechanistically)

Experimental Approaches to Test Interaction:

  1. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP):
     • Use PDCD10 and BBS1 antibodies
     • Test whether antibodies pull down both proteins
     • Validate in endothelial cell lysates

  2. Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H):
     • Use PDCD10 fragments as bait
     • Screen endothelial cDNA library
     • Confirm BBS1 as prey

  3. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR):
     • Measure direct binding kinetics
     • Determine binding affinity (Kd)
     • Test domain requirements

  4. Cell-Based Assays:
     • Co-localization studies (immunofluorescence)
     • Test function in endothelial cells
     • Analyze effects on vascular permeability
     • Monitor VEGFR2 and ciliary signaling

  5. Structural Studies:
     • X-ray crystallography of PDCD10-BBS1 complex
     • Cryo-EM if full BBSome involved
     • Identify interaction interface residues

  6. Genetic Studies:
     • Test interaction in model organisms (zebrafish, mouse)
     • Combined loss-of-function studies
     • Analyze vascular phenotypes

Significance if Validated:

If PDCD10-BBS1 interaction is confirmed:
  • New understanding of vascular barrier regulation
  • Potential explanation for cardiovascular involvement in BBS
  • New therapeutic targets (dual inhibition of CCM and ciliary pathways)
  • Insight into ciliary functions in endothelial cells
  • Potential biomarkers for disease severity

IX. THERAPEUTIC TARGETING AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT
================================================================================

9.1 Current Treatment Options

Unfortunately, no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for CCM exist.

Current Management:

    - Seizure control (anti-epileptic drugs)
    - Headache management
    - Blood pressure control
  • Surveillance (MRI monitoring)
  • Genetic counseling
  • Lifestyle modifications

Limitations:
  • Surgery not appropriate for:
    - Multiple lesions

================================================================================
XII. CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

PDCD10 (CCM3) is a multifunctional endothelial protein critical for vascular
integrity through its roles in:

1. Stabilization of VE-cadherin adherens junctions
2. VEGFR2 signaling regulation and angiogenesis
3. Rho/Rock pathway inhibition
4. GCKIII kinase stabilization and Golgi organization
5. Kidney epithelial barrier function

Mutations in PDCD10 cause cerebral cavernous malformations, a potentially
devastating vascular disease characterized by hemorrhagic lesions in the brain.
CCM3-associated disease typically presents earlier with more aggressive
phenotype than CCM1/2-associated disease.

The predicted interaction between PDCD10 and BBS1 (ipSAE=0.562) represents a
potentially novel mechanistic link between vascular integrity pathways and
ciliary transport machinery, specifically in endothelial cells. While the
interaction requires experimental validation, it suggests potential coordination
between:
  • CCM signaling (PDCD10) - junction stabilization
  • Ciliary transport (BBSome) - mechanosensing and signaling

This interaction, if confirmed, could explain some phenotypic overlap between
vascular disease in CCM and ciliary disorders like Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

Therapeutic Development:
  • REC-994 (AI-derived drug) recently completed Phase 2 with positive safety data
  • Multiple drug targets identified (ROCK, GCKIII, mTOR, ROS pathways)
  • Drug repurposing candidates show promise (vitamin D3, tempol)
  • GCKIII kinase activation may be protective (novel approach)
  • Combination therapies likely needed
  • Unmet need remains for preventive pharmacotherapy

Future directions:
  • Validate PDCD10-BBS1 interaction experimentally
  • Develop mechanism-based biomarkers
  • Expand clinical trials of promising candidates
  • Investigate ciliary dysfunction in CCM
  • Personalized medicine based on mutation type and genetic modifiers
  • Prevention of lesion formation before hemorrhage occurs
