- IFT27 is a member of IFT-B1 complex and functions as GTPase regulating BBSome export

GENE INFORMATION:
- Gene Symbol: PPP6C
- Official Name: Protein Phosphatase 6 Catalytic Subunit
- Aliases: PP6C, PP6
- Chromosomal Location: 9q33.3

================================================================================
1. PROTEIN STRUCTURE AND BIOCHEMISTRY
================================================================================

PROTEIN FAMILY:
PPP6C belongs to the PP2A family of serine/threonine phosphatases, which includes
three closely related members:
- PP2A (PPP2C) - most extensively studied
- PP4 (PPP4C)
- PP6 (PPP6C)

All three catalytic subunits (PP2AC, PP4C, and PP6C) were detected in rat tissue
extracts and can be purified from bovine testes. However, in contrast to PP2AC,
PP4C and PP6C exhibited relatively low phosphatase activity towards several
substrates tested in vitro.

HOLOENZYME STRUCTURE:
PP6 functions as a heterotrimeric holoenzyme complex consisting of:
1. Catalytic subunit: PPP6C (the phosphatase)
2. Regulatory subunit: One of three SAPS domain-containing proteins
   - PPP6R1 (also called SAPS1)
   - PPP6R2 (also called SAPS2)
   - PPP6R3 (also called SAPS3)
3. Ankyrin repeat-containing subunit: One of three ARS proteins
   - ARS-A (ankyrin repeat subunit A)
   - ARS-B
   - ARS-C

CATALYTIC PROPERTIES:
- Serine/threonine phosphatase activity
- Metal-dependent catalysis (like other PPP family members)
- Similar IC50 to PP2A for active site inhibitors:
  * Okadaic acid
  * Microcystin-LR
  * Calyculin A
  * Cantharidin

TISSUE DISTRIBUTION:
PPP6C is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues. Northern blot analysis
identified 3 transcript sizes: 1.8 kb, 4.2 kb, and 4.7 kb in all 16 human
tissues examined.

================================================================================
2. REGULATORY SUBUNITS AND PROTEIN INTERACTIONS
================================================================================

SAPS DOMAIN REGULATORY SUBUNITS:

The SAPS (Sit4-Associated Protein domain) family regulatory subunits (PPP6R1,
PPP6R2, PPP6R3) play critical roles in:
- Restricting substrate specificity
- Recruiting specific substrates to the phosphatase
- Determining intracellular localization of the holoenzyme
- Modulating catalytic activity

The SAPS domain of PPP6R1 is sufficient for association with PPP6C.

FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY:
The three regulatory subunits (PPP6R1, PPP6R2, PPP6R3) show functional redundancy
in certain contexts. For example, combined depletion of all three was required to
block TAK1 inhibitor-induced PANoptosis, whereas single knockdowns were
insufficient.

================================================================================
3. CELLULAR FUNCTIONS AND SIGNALING PATHWAYS
================================================================================

3.1 CELL CYCLE REGULATION

PPP6C is essential for proper cell cycle progression through multiple mechanisms:

MITOTIC REGULATION - Aurora A/TPX2 Axis:
One of the best-characterized PP6 functions is regulation of Aurora A kinase:
- PP6 holoenzyme is the major T-loop phosphatase for Aurora A
- Loss of PP6 causes increased Aurora A activity
- Results in enlarged mitotic spindles
- Causes chromosome alignment defects
- Leads to chromosome instability and micronucleation

Key findings:
- Purified PP6 dephosphorylates Aurora A-TPX2 complexes in vitro
- Catalytically inactive mutants cannot rescue PP6C depletion phenotype
- PP6 limits Aurora A-TPX2 activity to control spindle size
- Reference: DOI 10.1083/jcb.201008106 (J Cell Biol. 2010)
- Follow-up: DOI 10.1083/jcb.202205117 (J Cell Biol. 2023)

SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND CHROMOSOME SEGREGATION:
Depletion of PP6 catalytic or regulatory subunits:
- Interferes with spindle formation
- Causes chromosome alignment defects
- Leads to chromosome instability
- Increases Aurora A-dependent micronucleation

G1 TO S PHASE PROGRESSION:
- N-terminal domain restricts G1-S progression in cancer cells
- Partly through control of cyclin D1
- During mitosis, regulates spindle positioning

3.2 DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE AND REPAIR

DNA-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE (DNA-PK) ACTIVATION:
PP6 plays dual roles in DNA damage repair:
- PPP6R1 regulatory subunit targets PP6 to DNA-PK
- PP6 activates DNA-PK to trigger DNA repair
- Critical for double-strand break repair pathway
- Reference: PMID 22493060

DUAL FUNCTION IN CANCER:
Reduced PP6 activity:
- May contribute to cancer initiation/progression
- Through activation of Aurora A (AURKA)
- Promotion of cell cycle progression

Increased PP6 activity:
- Can promote DNA damage repair
- Through activation of DNA-PK

3.3 MAPK/ERK SIGNALING PATHWAY

MEK DEPHOSPHORYLATION:
PPP6C is a major MEK phosphatase in cells with oncogenic ERK pathway activation:
- Loss of PPP6C causes MEK hyperphosphorylation at:
  * Activating phosphorylation sites
  * Crosstalk phosphorylation sites
- Promotes ERK pathway signaling
- Decreases sensitivity to MEK inhibitors

Clinical significance:
- PPP6C is frequently mutated or downregulated in melanoma
- PPP6C acts as tumor suppressor by restraining oncogenic MAPK signaling
- Loss of PPP6C confers resistance to MEK inhibitor therapy
- Reference: PMID 33789117 (Cell Rep. 2021)

3.4 INNATE IMMUNITY AND ANTIVIRAL DEFENSE

RIG-I MEDIATED ANTIVIRAL SIGNALING:
PPP6C participates in innate immune defense through the WHIP-TRIM14-PPP6C
mitochondrial signalosome:

Mechanism:
- TRIM14 provides mitochondrial docking platform
- WHIP bridges RIG-I with MAVS via polyubiquitin chains
- PPP6C dephosphorylates RIG-I
- Dephosphorylation is essential step triggering RIG-I signaling activation
- Intact signalosome required for PPP6C-stimulated activity

Reference: PMID 29053956 (Mol Cell. 2017)

cGAS-STING DNA SENSING PATHWAY:
PPP6C is a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated innate immune response:
- DNA virus infection causes rapid PPP6C dissociation from cGAS
- Results in cGAS phosphorylation at S435 (human) / S420 (mouse)
- PPP6C dephosphorylation of this site suppresses:
  * cGAS substrate binding activity
  * cGAS binding to GTP
  * cGAMP synthesis
  * Downstream innate antiviral response

Reference: PMID 32474700 (Protein Cell. 2020)

IL-1 SIGNALING:
- PP6 down-regulates MAP3K7 (TAK1) kinase activation
- Modulates IL-1 signaling pathway through TAK1 dephosphorylation

NF-κB SIGNALING:
Multiple studies demonstrate PP6 exerts negative control at different steps of
NF-κB signaling:
- Targets IκBε for degradation
- Regulates TAK1 activity
- Modulates multiple upstream activators
- Reference: PMID 28592427 (Biochem Soc Trans. 2017)

3.5 TGF-β/SMAD SIGNALING

PP6 AS POSITIVE REGULATOR:
Unlike its negative regulatory roles in many pathways, PP6 promotes TGF-β signaling:

Mechanisms:
- TGF-β treatment increases PP6 protein levels (positive feedback)
- Via transcriptional and post-translational regulation
- Loss of Ppp6c suppresses:
  * TGF-β-induced canonical Smad3 phosphorylation at Ser423/425
  * Smad3 transcriptional activity
  * Non-canonical p38 MAPK pathway
  * TGF-β-induced cell migration

Note: The molecular mechanism by which PP6 loss decreases Smad Ser423/425
phosphorylation remains unclear and is under investigation.

Reference: PMC10788163 (J Biochem. 2024)

3.6 HIPPO SIGNALING PATHWAY

INDIRECT REGULATION VIA MOB1:
While PP2A-STRIPAK complex directly regulates MST1/MST2, PP6 regulates the Hippo
pathway through MOB1:
- PP6 module (containing PPP6C) interacts with MOB1
- Phosphorylation-dependent association
- MOB1 is phosphorylated by MST1/MST2 at N-terminus (including Thr35)
- MOB1 S9 and T35 phosphorylation increases upon PP6c degradation
- Mutation of MOB1 phosphopeptide-binding pocket affects PP6 association

Note: Direct dephosphorylation of MST1/MST2 is performed by PP2A-STRIPAK,
not PP6.

3.7 IL-2 RECEPTOR SIGNALING

PP6 is a component of signaling pathway regulating:
- Cell cycle progression in response to IL-2 receptor stimulation
- Lymphocyte activation and proliferation
- Reference: PMID 28592427

================================================================================
4. MELANOCYTE BIOLOGY AND MELANOMA
================================================================================

4.1 REGULATION OF MITF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR

PPP6C is a key regulator of MITF (Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor):
- MITF is lineage-specific transcription factor in melanocytes
- MITF also functions as oncogene in melanoma
- PPP6C modulates MITF activity through dephosphorylation

ZEBRAFISH DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL:
- PPP6C expression disrupts melanocyte differentiation
- Melanocyte disruption rescued by phosphomimetic mutations at MITF serine residues
- Demonstrates phosphorylation-dependent regulation

Reference: PMID 35368039 (Sci Rep. 2022)

4.2 MELANOMA-ASSOCIATED MUTATIONS

MUTATION FREQUENCY AND SPECTRUM:
- PPP6C mutations found in ~10% of melanoma tumors
- Coexist with BRAF and NRAS driver mutations
- PPP6C is ONLY recurrently mutated serine/threonine phosphatase across all
  human cancers identified in sequencing studies

R264C HOTSPOT MUTATION:
- Recurrent R264C mutation occurs EXCLUSIVELY in melanoma
- 57/58 tumors containing PPP6C R264C mutation were melanomas
- Highly specific melanoma biomarker

MUTATION TYPES AND DISTRIBUTION:
Sequencing of 310 melanoma specimens (233 primary, 77 metastatic) revealed:
- Large number of hotspot mutations
- Found in both primary and metastatic melanomas
- Minimal association between stage and PPP6C mutation presence
- Subpopulation of cells within tumors contain mutations
- Suggests PPP6C mutation is early but non-tumor-initiating event

STOP MUTATIONS:
Among primary patients with PPP6C mutations:
- Patients with stop (nonsense) mutations had significantly shorter recurrence-free
  survival compared to patients without stop mutations
- Indicates different functional consequences for different mutation types

4.3 FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF MELANOMA MUTATIONS

AURORA A DYSREGULATION:
Melanoma-associated mutations (e.g., H114Y) cause:
- Elevated Aurora A kinase activity

Reference: PMID 33743547 (Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2021)

================================================================================
5. DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS
================================================================================

5.1 CANCER

MELANOMA:
Most extensively characterized cancer association (see Section 4)
- ~10% mutation frequency
- Tumor suppressor function
- R264C hotspot mutation exclusive to melanoma
- Haploinsufficiency accelerates tumorigenesis

COLORECTAL CANCER:
PPP6C in RAS-mutant colorectal cancer:
- Identified as MEK phosphatase
- Loss confers resistance to MEK inhibitors
- Potential therapeutic target
- Reference: PMID 36993243 (Mol Cell Proteomics. 2023)

GENERAL CANCER BIOLOGY:
PPP6C mutations have dual and context-dependent effects:
- Reduced activity may promote cancer through:
  * Aurora A activation
  * Cell cycle promotion
  * Chromosome instability
- Increased activity may promote:
  * DNA damage repair (via DNA-PK)
  * Therapy resistance (via pathway activation)

5.2 HUMAN GENETIC DISORDERS

NO CONFIRMED HUMAN SYNDROME REPORTED:
Despite extensive searching, no well-defined human genetic syndrome caused by
germline PPP6C mutations has been documented in the literature as of 2025.

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
1. Embryonic lethality - Based on mouse models showing post-implantation lethality,
   complete loss-of-function may be incompatible with human development
2. Extremely rare - Mutations may be too rare to identify
3. Recently discovered - May not yet be published
4. Variable expressivity - May present with variable phenotypes making syndrome
   recognition difficult

RELATED PHOSPHATASE SYNDROMES:
Other PP2A family members cause human neurodevelopmental disorders:
- PPP2R5D mutations → Houge-Janssens syndrome (intellectual disability,
  macrocephaly, hypotonia)
- PPP2R1A mutations → Neurodevelopmental disorders with variable severity
- PPP3CA mutations → Early-onset epileptic encephalopathy

This suggests phosphatase genes are critical for neurodevelopment, and PPP6C
mutations might have similar but undiscovered effects.

5.3 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL PHENOTYPES

MOUSE KNOCKOUT - EMBRYONIC LETHALITY:
Complete loss of Ppp6c:
- Homozygous mutant embryos identified in blastocysts (appear normal)
- Embryos degenerate by E7.5
- Clear developmental defects by E8.5
- Death occurs after implantation
- Ppp6c is indispensable for post-implantation embryogenesis

Reference: PMID 26868000 (Mech Dev. 2016)

NEURON-SPECIFIC KNOCKOUT:
Conditional deletion of Ppp6c in neurons causes:
- Neonatal death
- Decreased number of cortical neurons in layers V-VI
- Decreased interneurons in layer I of neocortex
- Essential for neonatal survival
- Essential for proper neuron development

Reference: Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2023

CONDITIONAL KNOCKOUT LETHALITY:
- ShhCre/+-mediated Ppp6c knockout → embryonic lethal
- Unable to obtain ShhCre/+;Ppp6cflox/flox offspring
- Indicates essential role in Sonic Hedgehog-expressing tissues

================================================================================
6. CILIARY BIOLOGY AND POTENTIAL IFT27 CONNECTION
================================================================================

6.1 KNOWN ROLES OF PHOSPHATASES IN CILIA

GENERAL PHOSPHATASE LOCALIZATION:
Mass spectrometric analyses have identified phosphatase subunits in cilia:
- PP1 subunits in isolated Chlamydomonas cilia (Pazour et al., 2005)
- PP2A subunits in primary cilia of kidney epithelial cells (Ishikawa et al., 2012)
- Protein phosphatase 2C moderately abundant in control flagella
- PP2C undetectable in IFT-A deficient mutant flagella

However, these findings still await independent confirmation, and knowledge of
specific protein phosphatases antagonizing ciliary phosphorylations is
rudimentary.

PHOSPHOINOSITIDE PHOSPHATASES:
INPP5E (Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E):
- Joubert syndrome protein
- Localizes to centrosome
- Coordinates initiation of ciliogenesis
- PIPKIγ counteracts INPP5E in regulating TTBK2 recruitment
- Promotes CP110 removal and axoneme elongation

6.2 PPP6C CILIARY LOCALIZATION - NO EVIDENCE FOUND

Despite extensive literature searching, NO published evidence was found for:
- PPP6C localization to primary cilia
- PPP6C localization to motile cilia
- PPP6C role in ciliary assembly or disassembly
- PPP6C regulation of ciliary proteins
- PPP6C involvement in ciliopathies (except through general cell cycle/developmental roles)

This represents a significant knowledge gap, especially given:
- PPP6C's essential role in development
- The predicted interaction with IFT27
- Importance of phosphorylation in ciliary regulation

6.3 IFT27 BIOLOGY AND FUNCTION

IFT27 (INTRAFLAGELLAR TRANSPORT PROTEIN 27):

Gene Information:
- Also known as: BBS19 (Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 19)
- Component of IFT complex B (IFT-B)
- Small Rab-like GTPase
- Essential for ciliary protein trafficking

Primary Function - BBSome Export from Cilia:
IFT27 promotes exit of BBSome and associated cargoes from cilia through the
following mechanism:

1. IFT27 separates from rest of IFT-B complex inside cilia
2. IFT27 directly interacts with nucleotide-free form of ARL6 (BBS3)
3. IFT27 prevents aggregation of nucleotide-free ARL6
4. IFT27 promotes ARL6 activation
5. Activated ARL6 enables BBSome coat assembly
6. BBSome mediates ciliary exit of cargo proteins

Key Findings:
- Loss of IFT27 reduces ciliary exit rates of BBSome
- Causes ciliary accumulation of:
  * ARL6
  * BBSome components
  * GPR161 (GPCR involved in Hedgehog signaling)
- IFT27 specifically promotes exit, with no influence on entry
- Links BBSome to IFT machinery

- Retinitis pigmentosa (progressive vision loss)
- Postaxial polydactyly (extra digits)
- Obesity
- Hypogonadism
- Cognitive impairment
- Kidney dysfunction

  "Identification and Characterization of Known Biallelic Mutations in the IFT27
  (BBS19) Gene in a Novel Family With Bardet-Biedl Syndrome"

RELATIONSHIP TO BBSome:
- BBS is caused by mutations in BBSome subunits AND some IFT-B subunits
- IFT-B subunits associated with BBS:
  * IFT27/BBS19 (forms heterodimer with IFT25)
  * IFT74/BBS22 (forms heterodimer with IFT81)
  * IFT172/BBS20
- Delineates novel mechanism for BBS pathogenesis through IFT machinery

HEDGEHOG SIGNALING:
- IFT27 controls ciliary levels of GPR161
- GPR161 is negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling
- IFT27 loss causes GPR161 accumulation in cilia
- Results in aberrant Hedgehog pathway regulation
- Lztfl1 functions downstream of IFT27 to couple BBSome to IFT for coordinated
  Patched-1 and Smoothened removal during Hh signaling

6.4 HYPOTHETICAL PPP6C-IFT27 CONNECTION

PREDICTED INTERACTION SIGNIFICANCE:
The predicted interaction between PPP6C and IFT27 (ipSAE = 0.670) is intriguing
because it links:
- A serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP6C)
- A GTPase regulating ciliary export (IFT27)

POTENTIAL MECHANISMS:

Hypothesis 1 - Phosphorylation-Dependent Regulation of IFT27:
- IFT27 activity or localization might be regulated by phosphorylation
- PPP6C could dephosphorylate IFT27 to modulate:
  * GTPase activity
  * Interaction with ARL6/BBS3
  * Separation from IFT-B complex
  * BBSome recruitment efficiency

Hypothesis 2 - Regulation of IFT27-Interacting Proteins:
PPP6C might dephosphorylate proteins that interact with IFT27:
- ARL6/BBS3 (GTPase)
- BBSome components
- IFT-B complex members
- Could modulate assembly/disassembly of IFT27 complexes

Hypothesis 3 - Cell Cycle-Ciliary Coordination:
PPP6C is essential for:
- Cell cycle progression
- Mitotic spindle regulation
- Aurora A activity control

Cilia are:
- Disassembled before mitosis
- Reassembled after cell division
- Coordinated with cell cycle

PPP6C-IFT27 interaction could coordinate:
- Ciliary disassembly timing
- BBSome-mediated protein export before mitosis
- Cell cycle progression with ciliary dynamics

Hypothesis 4 - Developmental Signaling Integration:
Both proteins are essential for development:
- PPP6C: embryonic lethal knockout, essential for post-implantation development
- IFT27: causes BBS ciliopathy, affects Hedgehog signaling

PPP6C regulates multiple developmental pathways:
- TGF-β/SMAD signaling (positive regulator)
- ERK/MAPK signaling (negative regulator)
- Hippo pathway (via MOB1)

IFT27 regulates:
- Hedgehog signaling (via GPR161 trafficking)

PPP6C-IFT27 interaction might integrate:
- Ciliary signaling (Hedgehog)
- Non-ciliary pathways (TGF-β, MAPK, Hippo)
- During embryonic development

Hypothesis 5 - False Positive or Transient Interaction:
Given medium confidence score (ipSAE = 0.670):
- Interaction might be false positive
- Or represents transient/weak interaction
- May occur only under specific conditions
- May be context-dependent (cell cycle stage, signaling state)

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES NEEDED:
To validate and characterize PPP6C-IFT27 interaction:
1. Co-immunoprecipitation in ciliated cells
2. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) for endogenous proteins
3. Test if interaction is phosphorylation-dependent
4. Examine if PPP6C localizes to cilia or centrosomes
5. Check if PPP6C depletion affects:
   - IFT27 localization
   - BBSome trafficking
   - Ciliary length
   - Hedgehog signaling
6. Test if IFT27 is phosphorylated and whether PPP6C dephosphorylates it
7. Examine interaction during different cell cycle phases

CURRENT KNOWLEDGE GAP:
No published studies have investigated:
- PPP6C in ciliary biology
- PPP6C-IFT27 interaction
- Phosphorylation regulation of IFT27
- Phosphatases regulating BBSome export

This represents a potentially novel regulatory mechanism worthy of investigation.

13. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

PPP6C (Protein Phosphatase 6 Catalytic Subunit) is an essential serine/threonine
phosphatase with diverse roles in cellular regulation:

KEY FUNCTIONS:
- Cell cycle regulation (Aurora A/TPX2 dephosphorylation)
- DNA damage repair (DNA-PK activation)
- MAPK pathway regulation (MEK dephosphorylation)
- Innate immunity (RIG-I and cGAS dephosphorylation)
- TGF-β signaling (Smad3 regulation)
- Hippo pathway (MOB1 dephosphorylation)
- Melanocyte differentiation (MITF regulation)

DISEASE RELEVANCE:
- Melanoma: ~10% mutation frequency, R264C hotspot exclusive to melanoma
- Tumor suppressor function through restraint of Aurora A and MEK/ERK
- Mutations confer Aurora A inhibitor sensitivity
- Loss confers MEK inhibitor resistance
- Essential for embryonic development (knockout is lethal)
- No confirmed human germline mutation syndrome

PPP6C-IFT27 CONNECTION:
The predicted interaction between PPP6C and IFT27 (ipSAE = 0.670) is
scientifically intriguing but currently uncharacterized:

WHY IT MATTERS:
1. IFT27 is GTPase regulating BBSome export from cilia
2. IFT27 mutations cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome
3. Phosphorylation is key regulatory mechanism in cilia
4. PPP6C might regulate IFT27 or IFT27-associated proteins
5. Could coordinate cell cycle with ciliary dynamics
6. Both genes essential for development

CURRENT KNOWLEDGE GAP:
- No published evidence for PPP6C in ciliary biology
- No studies of phosphorylation regulation of IFT27
- No investigation of phosphatases in BBSome trafficking
- Represents potential novel regulatory mechanism

RESEARCH PRIORITY:
Given PPP6C's roles in:
- Development (essential for embryogenesis)
- Cell cycle (Aurora A, mitotic spindle)
- Multiple signaling pathways (MAPK, TGF-β, Hippo)

And IFT27's roles in:
- Ciliary protein export
- Bardet-Biedl syndrome
- Hedgehog signaling
- Development

Investigating this interaction could reveal:
- Novel ciliary phosphorylation mechanisms
- Cell cycle-cilia coordination
- New therapeutic targets for ciliopathies
- Integration of ciliary and non-ciliary signaling

RECOMMENDATION:
This interaction warrants experimental validation and detailed characterization,
as it may represent an undiscovered link between phosphatase signaling and
ciliary trafficking machinery.
