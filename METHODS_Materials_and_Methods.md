## AlphaFold3 Interaction Prediction and Analysis

Protein-protein interactions were predicted using AlphaFold3 (Google DeepMind) for pairwise combinations of 33 human ciliary proteins (22 IFT proteins, 10 BBSome components, and 1 IFT-associated protein, TULP3). Each prediction was analyzed using a custom Python pipeline implementing the ipSAE (interface Predicted Aligned Error Structure-based Average Estimate) scoring metric as described by Dunbrack (2025).

The ipSAE score provides a more robust measure of interaction confidence than the standard iPTM (interface predicted TM-score) metric, particularly for proteins containing disordered regions or non-interacting domains. For each protein pair, the ipSAE score was calculated as the maximum of two asymmetric directional scores (A→B and B→A) according to Equations 14-16 in Dunbrack (2025). Briefly, for each residue i in the aligned chain, a TM-score-like value was computed over all residues j in the scored chain where the predicted aligned error (PAE) value PAE_ij was less than 10 Å. The length-dependent scaling factor d₀ was calculated as 1.24 × (L - 15)^(1/3) - 1.8 for L ≥ 27 residues and 1.0 otherwise, where L represents the number of residue pairs below the PAE cutoff. The per-residue score was then computed as the mean of 1/(1 + (PAE_ij/d₀)²) across all qualifying residues, and the final ipSAE score was taken as the maximum per-residue score across all alignment residues.

Predicted interfaces were validated structurally by parsing mmCIF coordinate files and calculating Cβ-Cβ distances (Cα for glycine). Only residue pairs satisfying both PAE < 6 Å AND Cβ-Cβ distance ≤ 8 Å were counted as bona fide interface contacts, ensuring that predicted interactions showed both low predicted error and genuine spatial proximity in the structural model. For validated interface residues, we calculated the mean interface pLDDT (per-residue confidence score) by extracting atom-level pLDDT values from the AlphaFold3 prediction data and averaging across all atoms within interface residues. Additional interface quality metrics included PAE contact counts at multiple thresholds (< 3 Å, < 5 Å, < 6 Å, < 8 Å, and < 12 Å) and the overall iPTM score from the AlphaFold3 output.

Predictions were classified into confidence tiers based on ipSAE values following the benchmarked thresholds established by Dunbrack (2025): high confidence (ipSAE > 0.7), representing strong evidence of true interaction with virtually no false positives; medium confidence (ipSAE 0.5-0.7), indicating likely genuine interactions; low confidence (ipSAE 0.3-0.5), representing weak signals requiring visual inspection; and very low confidence (ipSAE < 0.3), likely representing non-interactions. To minimize false positives, predictions with ipSAE < 0.3 were excluded from the final dataset. The analysis pipeline processed AlphaFold3 output files (*_summary_confidences*.json and *_full_data_*.json or *_confidences.json), calculated ipSAE scores from PAE matrices, validated interfaces using structural coordinates, computed interface-specific quality metrics, and exported results in machine-readable JSON format, human-readable summary text files, and Excel spreadsheets.

## Database Construction and Web Visualization

The analyzed interaction data were imported into a PostgreSQL database (Neon serverless platform) using custom Node.js scripts. The database schema comprised three main tables: a proteins table storing UniProt identifiers, gene names, and organism information for all proteins; an interactions table containing bait-prey relationships along with quality metrics including ipSAE score, ipSAE confidence classification, iPTM score, interface pLDDT statistics, PAE contact counts, and source file paths; and a protein_aliases table linking proteins to alternative identifiers and gene names retrieved from the UniProt REST API (https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/). Gene name fetching was rate-limited to one request per second to comply with API usage guidelines. Only single-protein bait predictions (pairwise A-B format) were imported into the database; multi-protein complex predictions (AB:C format) were excluded from this analysis. The final curated dataset comprised 512 unique interactions among 371 proteins.

An interactive web application was developed to enable exploration of the complete interaction network. The frontend was implemented using Next.js 14 and React 18, featuring a force-directed graph visualization (react-force-graph-2d library, version 1.25.5) where nodes represent proteins and edges represent predicted interactions. Edge colors indicate confidence levels (green for high, orange for medium, red for low) and edge thickness is proportional to ipSAE score. Users can click on nodes to explore secondary interactions and filter results by confidence level. A sortable data table displays all interactions ranked by ipSAE score, with columns showing confidence classification, ipSAE value, iPTM score, interface pLDDT, and PAE contact counts. Protein names are displayed with their common aliases (e.g., WDR19/IFT144, ARL6/BBS3) to facilitate identification. The interface supports searching by UniProt ID, gene name, or protein alias, and results can be exported in CSV format.

The backend consists of Next.js API routes serving JSON data from the PostgreSQL database, with real-time confidence filtering and client-side sorting by ipSAE score. Database queries are optimized using indexed lookups on protein identifiers and bait-prey relationships, with protein alias resolution performed via SQL LEFT JOIN operations. The web application is deployed on the Vercel platform with automatic continuous deployment from a GitHub repository (https://github.com/essebesse/IFT_interactors), ensuring that the publicly accessible resource remains synchronized with the source code and database content.

## Software and Data Availability

AlphaFold3 predictions were generated using the AlphaFold3 software (Google DeepMind). Analysis was performed using Python 3 with NumPy and Pandas libraries. Database operations used Node.js 18+ with the @vercel/postgres client library (version 0.9.0). The web application was built with Next.js 14.2, React 18, Bootstrap 5.3, and react-force-graph-2d 1.25.5. The complete source code for the analysis pipeline and web application is available at https://github.com/essebesse/IFT_interactors. The interactive web interface providing access to all 512 analyzed interactions is publicly available at https://ift-interactors.vercel.app/. Raw analysis output including all calculated metrics is provided in Supplementary Data File 1.
