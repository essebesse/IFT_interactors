## In Silico Prediction of IFT and BBSome Interacting Proteins

Intraflagellar transport (IFT) mediated by the IFT-B and IFT-A complexes, together with the BBSome, constitutes the primary ciliary trafficking machinery responsible for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella. While the core composition and architecture of these complexes are well established, the mechanisms by which specific cargo proteins are recognized, loaded, and transported remain poorly understood. Although numerous ciliary proteins depend on IFT for their localization, direct physical interactions between IFT/BBSome components and their cargo proteins have been identified for only a small subset of ciliary proteins. Furthermore, the potential for transient or context-dependent interactions between IFT complexes and regulatory proteins outside the core machinery remains largely unexplored. To comprehensively map the interaction landscape of the ciliary trafficking system, we performed in silico pulldown experiments using AlphaPulldown based on the AlphaFold3 algorithm.

We used 33 human proteins as baits, comprising 22 IFT proteins (representing both IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes), 10 BBSome components, and the IFT-associated cargo adaptor TULP3. As prey proteins, we compiled a comprehensive library of approximately 1,500 human ciliary proteins by combining entries from the curated database of ciliary proteins maintained by Greg Pazour (http://chlamyfp.org/ChlamyFPv2/index.php), the cilia "gold standard" protein set, and proteins annotated in CiliaCarta. This prey library encompasses known structural components of the ciliary axoneme, ciliary membrane proteins, signaling molecules, and proteins with established or suspected ciliary functions, providing broad coverage of the ciliary proteome.

Each bait-prey pair was subjected to structure prediction using AlphaFold3, and the resulting predictions were analyzed using the ipSAE (interface Predicted Aligned Error Structure-based Average Estimate) scoring metric, which provides a more robust assessment of interaction confidence than the standard iPTM score, particularly for proteins containing disordered regions or non-interacting domains. The ipSAE score was calculated for each predicted complex using a 10 Å PAE cutoff, with interface residues validated by structural proximity (Cβ-Cβ distance ≤ 8 Å) in the predicted models. Predictions were classified into confidence tiers following the benchmarked thresholds established by Dunbrack: high confidence (ipSAE > 0.7), representing strong evidence of true interaction with virtually no false positives; medium confidence (ipSAE 0.5-0.7), indicating likely genuine interactions; and low confidence (ipSAE 0.3-0.5), representing weak signals requiring additional validation. Predictions with ipSAE < 0.3 were excluded as likely non-interactions, yielding a final curated dataset of 512 interactions among 371 proteins.

Prior to exploring novel interactions, we first validated the accuracy of our approach by examining whether AlphaFold3 could recapitulate known physical interactions within the established IFT-B, IFT-A, and BBSome complexes. These well-characterized intra-complex interactions serve as essential positive controls, demonstrating that the ipSAE scoring metric effectively identifies bona fide protein-protein interactions and establishing confidence in the method's ability to discover novel associations beyond the characterized core complexes.
