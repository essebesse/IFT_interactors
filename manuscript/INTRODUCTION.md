# Introduction

Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that project from the surface of most vertebrate cells and serve critical roles in cellular signaling, sensory perception, and fluid movement. Defects in ciliary structure or function cause a diverse group of genetic disorders collectively termed ciliopathies, which affect multiple organ systems including the kidney, retina, skeleton, and brain. The clinical manifestations of ciliopathies—ranging from polycystic kidney disease and retinal degeneration to skeletal dysplasia and intellectual disability—reflect the widespread importance of cilia in development and tissue homeostasis. Despite significant advances in identifying ciliopathy disease genes, the molecular mechanisms linking ciliary protein dysfunction to these pleiotropic phenotypes remain incompletely understood.

Assembly and maintenance of cilia depend critically on intraflagellar transport (IFT), a bidirectional trafficking system that moves protein cargo along the ciliary axoneme. IFT is mediated by two large multi-protein complexes—IFT-A and IFT-B—that function as cargo carriers. IFT-B, comprising approximately 16 subunits, associates with the anterograde motor kinesin-2 to transport cargo from the ciliary base to the tip. IFT-A, containing at least 6 core subunits, couples to the retrograde motor dynein-2 to return proteins to the cell body. Together, these complexes orchestrate the delivery of structural components for cilium assembly and the trafficking of signaling receptors that mediate key developmental pathways including Hedgehog, Wnt, and GPCR signaling.

The BBSome represents a specialized cargo adapter complex that selectively recognizes specific membrane proteins for ciliary entry or exit. Composed of 8 core subunits (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9, and BBS18/BBIP1), the BBSome is recruited to ciliary membranes by the small GTPase ARL6 (also known as BBS3) and functions in the trafficking of GPCRs, smoothened, and other transmembrane proteins. Mutations in BBSome components cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by obesity, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, kidney defects, and intellectual disability. Understanding the molecular interactions that govern BBSome assembly, membrane recruitment, and cargo recognition is essential for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have revealed high-resolution structures of IFT trains assembled from IFT-A and IFT-B complexes, as well as the BBSome architecture. These structures have illuminated the overall organization of these large assemblies and identified interfaces between core subunits. However, the broader interaction landscape—including transient regulatory interactions, cargo recognition mechanisms, and connections to cellular trafficking pathways—remains largely unexplored. Systematic mapping of protein-protein interactions within IFT and BBSome networks is needed to construct a comprehensive systems-level view of ciliary trafficking.

Traditional experimental approaches for interaction mapping, including yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens, affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), and co-immunoprecipitation, have identified hundreds of interactions involving IFT and BBSome proteins. However, these methods face limitations including false negatives from transient or low-affinity interactions, false positives from indirect associations in large complexes, and incomplete coverage due to technical challenges with particular protein families. Moreover, experimental interaction screens are resource-intensive and typically focus on model organisms rather than systematically surveying human proteins relevant to disease.

The recent development of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 has revolutionized structural biology by enabling accurate prediction of protein structures and protein-protein interactions from sequence information alone. AlphaFold3, in particular, introduces explicit modeling of protein complexes with integrated confidence metrics that assess interface quality. The interface Predicted Aligned Error (ipSAE) score combines information about global structure accuracy (iPTM) with local interface precision (PAE) to provide a quantitative measure of interaction confidence. Recent studies have demonstrated that AlphaFold-predicted interactions show substantial overlap with experimental databases, with high-confidence predictions often validated by subsequent biochemical experiments.

Computational interaction prediction offers complementary advantages to experimental approaches. AlphaFold can systematically screen large numbers of protein pairs, identify structurally compatible interactions regardless of binding affinity or complex stability, and prioritize candidates for experimental validation. Critically, AlphaFold predictions are based on structural compatibility rather than cellular co-localization, potentially revealing biologically relevant interactions that occur only under specific conditions or in particular subcellular compartments.

Here, we present a comprehensive AlphaFold3-predicted interactome of human IFT and BBSome proteins. We systematically predicted interactions between 35 bait proteins (22 IFT complex subunits, 9 BBSome components, and 4 IFT-associated regulatory proteins) and 1,536 prey candidates comprising ciliary and trafficking-associated proteins curated from the Cildb and SysCilia databases. Using AlphaPulldown v4 with integrated ipSAE scoring, we generated and analyzed structure predictions to identify direct physical interactions.

Our analysis yielded 548 predicted protein-protein interactions involving 384 unique proteins, which we stratified into high, medium, and low confidence categories based on ipSAE scores. To assess prediction accuracy, we systematically compared our dataset against BioGRID, a curated database of experimental protein interactions. We observed remarkable validation rates, with 75% of high-confidence predictions (15/20) independently confirmed by prior experimental studies—substantially exceeding typical validation rates for computational interaction predictions.

Network topology analysis revealed that TULP3, a known cargo adapter linking IFT-A to membrane proteins, functions as a super-hub with 74 predicted interactions and the highest betweenness centrality in the network. This finding suggests TULP3 plays a more extensive role in coordinating ciliary trafficking than previously appreciated. We identified 472 novel predictions (86.1%) not present in BioGRID, providing a rich set of experimentally testable hypotheses.

To make these data broadly accessible, we developed an interactive web application (https://ift-interactors.vercel.app) that enables exploration of the interaction network, visualization of 3D structure predictions, and export of data for computational analysis. Complete datasets including confidence scores, interface quality metrics, and experimental validations are provided as supplementary materials.

This work demonstrates the power of focused AlphaFold3 screening for mapping interaction networks in specialized cellular systems and provides the ciliary biology community with a comprehensive resource for mechanistic studies of IFT/BBSome function and ciliopathy disease mechanisms.
