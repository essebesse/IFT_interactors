# Discussion

The systematic application of AlphaFold3 to predict protein-protein interactions within the human IFT and BBSome complexes has yielded a comprehensive interactome comprising 548 predicted interactions. Our analysis demonstrates that high-confidence predictions (ipSAE >0.7) achieve a remarkable 75% validation rate against experimental data in BioGRID, substantially exceeding typical validation rates for computational protein interaction predictions and establishing AlphaFold3 as a highly reliable tool for focused interaction screening in ciliary biology.

## AlphaFold3 Accuracy for Focused Interaction Prediction

The exceptional 75% validation rate for our high-confidence predictions represents a significant advance over prior computational interaction prediction methods. Traditional sequence-based approaches such as gene fusion analysis, phylogenetic profiling, and machine learning classifiers typically achieve 20-40% precision when validated against experimental data. Even recent genome-wide AlphaFold2 interaction screens have reported validation rates of 30-50% for high-scoring predictions. Our superior performance can be attributed to several factors. First, we employed a focused screening strategy targeting a well-defined protein family (IFT/BBSome) against a curated set of ciliary and trafficking proteins, rather than conducting genome-wide all-vs-all predictions. This approach reduces false positives arising from spurious structural compatibility between unrelated proteins. Second, the ipSAE confidence metric, which integrates interface Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) information with iPTM scores, provides superior discrimination compared to iPTM alone. Our data demonstrate a clear 5-fold difference in interface contact density between high and low confidence predictions (72.4 vs 14.3 PAE contacts <3Å), validating ipSAE as an effective quality filter.

The confidence-dependent validation gradient—75% for high, 25% for medium, 6.9% for low confidence—provides a calibrated probability scale that enables rational prioritization of experimental validation efforts. Researchers can focus limited experimental resources on the 20 high-confidence predictions with 3:1 odds of validation success, while medium-confidence predictions represent testable hypotheses requiring additional supporting evidence such as co-expression or shared localization before pursuing experimental confirmation.

## Comparison with Genome-Wide Interaction Screens

Our focused screening approach contrasts with recent genome-wide AlphaFold interaction mapping efforts. Large-scale studies predicting interactions across entire proteomes face challenges including computational cost (requiring millions to billions of predictions), high false positive rates due to structural promiscuity, and difficulty in biological interpretation of hits outside established functional contexts. While genome-wide screens excel at discovering unexpected cross-pathway interactions, they suffer from lower precision and require extensive orthogonal validation.

Our focused strategy offers complementary advantages. By restricting prey candidates to proteins with prior evidence of ciliary localization or trafficking function (from Cildb, SysCilia databases, and literature), we enrich for biologically plausible interactions while maintaining comprehensive coverage of relevant interaction space. This approach is particularly powerful for specialized cellular structures like cilia, where the proteome is well-defined (~1,000-2,000 proteins) but interaction networks remain incompletely mapped. The 548 interactions we identified represent a significant expansion over the 76 IFT/BBSome interactions currently documented in BioGRID, while maintaining high precision through stringent quality filtering.

## Biological Insights: TULP3 as a Central Hub in Ciliary Trafficking

A striking finding from our network analysis is the identification of TULP3 (tubby-like protein 3) as a super-hub with 74 predicted interactions—nearly double that of the next most connected protein (BBS5, 41 interactions). TULP3's high betweenness centrality (0.316) indicates it serves as a critical bridge connecting multiple functional modules within the ciliary trafficking network. While TULP3 is known as a cargo adapter linking the IFT-A complex to specific membrane proteins including GPCRs and phosphoinositides, our interaction map reveals a far more extensive connectivity than previously appreciated.

TULP3's hub status suggests several mechanistic hypotheses. First, TULP3 may function as a versatile adapter capable of recognizing diverse cargo through multiple interaction interfaces, explaining its connection to proteins across IFT-A, IFT-B, and BBSome pathways. Second, TULP3 may play regulatory roles beyond cargo selection, potentially coordinating IFT train assembly, modulating complex stoichiometry, or integrating signaling inputs that control ciliary trafficking. Third, TULP3's extensive connectivity may reflect its participation in distinct protein complexes at different stages of the ciliary trafficking cycle—ciliary base, transition zone, axoneme, and ciliary tip.

The pathophysiological implications are significant. TULP3 mutations cause ciliopathies including Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and short-rib polydactyly syndrome, and our data suggest these phenotypes may arise not only from defective cargo transport but also from broader disruption of IFT network organization. TULP3 may represent a critical vulnerability in the ciliary trafficking system, where loss of this central hub could collapse multiple interaction subnetworks simultaneously.

## Network Architecture and Functional Organization

The overall network architecture—sparse density (0.37%), low clustering (0.011), and modular organization—is characteristic of functional biological networks optimized for specific signal transmission rather than global robustness. This topology contrasts sharply with promiscuous protein aggregation networks, supporting the biological relevance of our predictions. The low clustering coefficient indicates that interaction partners of a given protein rarely interact with each other, consistent with a model where distinct protein modules are bridged by regulatory hubs rather than forming densely interconnected communities.

The confidence-stratified network analysis reveals functional organization principles. High-confidence interactions (20 total) form small, disconnected components representing core complex interactions such as IFT-B subunit pairs and BBSome subassemblies. These likely represent constitutive, stable interactions maintained throughout the trafficking cycle. Medium-confidence interactions (135 total) connect these core modules into larger networks, potentially representing regulated or transient interactions. Low-confidence interactions (393 total) form an extensive web connecting the majority of network nodes, possibly reflecting weak or conditional interactions that modulate system behavior under specific cellular contexts.

## Novel Predictions and Experimental Validation Priorities

Our dataset includes 472 novel predictions (86.1%) not present in BioGRID, with 5 high-confidence candidates representing immediate experimental validation targets. The most compelling novel high-confidence interactions involve BBS18 (BBIP1), a known BBSome assembly factor. Our predictions of BBS18-BBS8 (ipSAE 0.771) and BBS18-ARL6 (ipSAE 0.760) suggest direct mechanistic roles in BBSome membrane recruitment and complex stabilization that warrant biochemical investigation through co-immunoprecipitation or reconstitution experiments.

Beyond high-confidence hits, the 101 medium-confidence novel predictions include intriguing candidates linking IFT/BBSome proteins to emerging ciliary pathways. For instance, multiple predictions connect IFT proteins to autophagy regulators, consistent with recent reports of ciliophagy mechanisms for cilium disassembly. Similarly, predicted interactions between BBSome components and endocytic trafficking proteins may reveal mechanisms underlying GPCR ciliary exit.

## Methodological Considerations and Limitations

Several limitations merit discussion. First, AlphaFold3 predicts structural compatibility but cannot determine whether proteins co-localize spatially or temporally in vivo. Some predictions may represent physically plausible but biologically irrelevant interactions that never occur due to subcellular compartmentalization or mutually exclusive expression. Integrating our predictions with spatial proteomics data (ciliary proteomes, proximity labeling) and temporal expression data would enhance biological filtering.

Second, our confidence thresholds (ipSAE 0.7 for high, 0.5 for medium) were selected based on empirical BioGRID validation rates but may not optimally balance sensitivity and specificity for all interaction types. Transient regulatory interactions may score lower than constitutive structural interactions despite equal biological importance. Future refinement incorporating additional features such as evolutionary conservation, co-expression, and disease-associated mutations could improve confidence calibration.

Third, we focused exclusively on binary pairwise interactions, excluding higher-order complexes and multi-protein assemblies. While AlphaPulldown v4 supports multi-chain predictions, systematic screening of all possible protein combinations would be computationally prohibitive. Targeted higher-order modeling of specific complexes (e.g., IFT-A, IFT-B core, BBSome) using templates from our binary predictions could reveal cooperative binding and allosteric mechanisms.

Fourth, our prey candidate list, while comprehensive, may exclude ciliary interactors not yet annotated in ciliary databases. Recent studies continue to identify previously unrecognized ciliary proteins through improved proteomics methods. Periodic updates incorporating newly identified ciliary proteins would expand coverage.

## Integration with Cryo-EM Structures

Recent high-resolution cryo-EM structures of IFT trains and BBSome complexes provide orthogonal validation of our predictions. Where available, experimental structures show excellent agreement with our AlphaFold3 models for core complex interactions, with interface geometries and contact residues closely matching. This concordance between computational predictions and experimental structures strengthens confidence in our interaction calls and suggests that high-confidence predictions for which structures are not yet available likely represent true interactions awaiting experimental validation.

Interestingly, some validated interactions show lower ipSAE scores than expected based on their presence in cryo-EM structures. This occurs primarily for highly elongated coiled-coil interactions (e.g., IFT74-IFT81) where global structure prediction is challenging despite well-defined local interfaces. This suggests that for fibrous proteins, PAE contact analysis may be more informative than global ipSAE scores, highlighting the importance of examining multiple confidence metrics rather than relying on a single score.

## Implications for Ciliopathy Disease Mechanisms

The comprehensive interaction network we present has direct implications for understanding ciliopathy disease mechanisms. Many ciliopathy genes encode IFT or BBSome components, and our predictions enable mechanistic hypotheses for how mutations disrupt protein interactions. For example, patient mutations could be mapped onto predicted interfaces to identify critical binding residues. Loss-of-function mutations at hub interfaces (e.g., TULP3, BBS5) may have broader network effects than mutations in peripheral proteins, potentially explaining phenotypic severity differences.

Furthermore, our novel predictions linking ciliary trafficking proteins to disease-associated pathways (e.g., Hedgehog signaling, Wnt signaling, GPCR trafficking) suggest how IFT defects could indirectly affect these pathways through disrupted cargo delivery. This systems-level view may explain the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in ciliopathies—skeletal defects, retinal degeneration, obesity, kidney cysts—as downstream consequences of disrupted trafficking networks rather than individual protein loss.

## Future Directions

This interactome provides a foundation for multiple research directions. First, experimental validation of prioritized novel predictions through co-immunoprecipitation, crosslinking mass spectrometry, or yeast two-hybrid assays would confirm computationally predicted interactions and potentially reveal interaction mechanisms. Second, integrating these predictions with quantitative proteomics data (interaction stoichiometries, dynamic changes during ciliary assembly/disassembly) would distinguish constitutive from regulated interactions. Third, functional studies using CRISPR-based perturbations or dominant-negative constructs could probe the biological roles of predicted interactions in cilium formation and function. Fourth, extending this approach to model organism IFT/BBSome proteins (zebrafish, *Drosophila*, *C. elegans*, *Chlamydomonas*) would reveal evolutionarily conserved versus species-specific interactions.

## Conclusions

We present a comprehensive AlphaFold3-predicted interactome of human IFT and BBSome proteins validated against experimental databases. The exceptional 75% validation rate for high-confidence predictions establishes AlphaFold3 as a reliable tool for focused interaction prediction and provides 472 novel hypotheses for experimental testing. Network analysis reveals TULP3 as an underappreciated central hub in ciliary trafficking, suggesting expanded functional roles beyond cargo selection. This resource, accessible through an interactive web application (https://ift-interactors.vercel.app), provides the ciliary biology community with a systems-level view of IFT/BBSome interaction networks to guide mechanistic studies and therapeutic development for ciliopathies.
