## Comprehensive AlphaFold3-predicted Interactome of Human Intraflagellar Transport and BBSome Proteins Reveals Novel Ciliary Trafficking Networks

**Background:** Intraflagellar transport (IFT) and BBSome protein complexes are essential ciliary trafficking machinery whose dysfunction causes ciliopathies. While core complex architectures are known from structural studies, the broader interaction landscape remains incompletely characterized.

**Methods:** We employed AlphaFold3 to systematically predict protein-protein interactions for 35 human IFT and BBSome bait proteins against 1,536 ciliary and trafficking-associated prey candidates. Using AlphaPulldown with integrated interface Predicted Aligned Error (ipSAE) scoring, we generated and analyzed structure predictions to identify direct physical interactions.

**Results:** We identified 548 predicted protein-protein interactions involving 384 unique proteins, stratified into high (n=20, 3.6%), medium (n=135, 24.6%), and low (n=393, 71.7%) confidence categories. Validation against BioGRID experimental data revealed exceptional concordance, with 75% of high-confidence predictions (15/20) independently confirmed by prior experiments, compared to 25.2% for medium and 6.9% for low confidence predictions. High-confidence interactions exhibited 5-fold higher interface contact density (72.4 vs 14.3 high-precision PAE contacts <3Å) compared to low-confidence predictions, validating ipSAE as an effective quality metric. Network analysis identified TULP3 as a super-hub with 74 interactions and highest betweenness centrality (0.316), suggesting an underappreciated central role in ciliary cargo trafficking. We report 472 novel predictions (86.1%) not present in BioGRID, providing a rich resource of experimentally testable hypotheses.

**Conclusions:** This comprehensive AlphaFold3 interactome reveals the systems-level organization of human IFT and BBSome protein networks with experimentally validated accuracy. The 75% validation rate for high-confidence predictions demonstrates AlphaFold3's reliability for focused interaction screening, while novel predictions expand our understanding of ciliary trafficking mechanisms and provide prioritized targets for experimental validation and therapeutic intervention in ciliopathies.
