## Key Mechanistic Insights

### Activation Mechanism
1. **Inactive state**: BBS1 β-propeller contacts BBS2; ARL6 binding site is occluded
2. **ARL6-GTP binding**: Triggers swiveling of BBS1 β-propeller domain (~30° rotation)
3. **Conformational change**:
   - Breaks BBS1-BBS2 interaction
   - Opens central cavity in BBSome
   - Allows ARL6 to bind composite site (BBS1 blades 1,7 + BBS7)
4. **BBS7 ordering**: Disordered BBS7 loop becomes ordered, forms β-addition with ARL6
5. **Result**: Activated BBSome recruits to ciliary membranes via ARL6

### Structural Modularity
- **Head module**: BBS2-BBS7 (asymmetric heterodimer)
- **Neck module**: BBS2-BBS9 coiled-coils + BBS7 contact
- **Body module**: BBS1, BBS4, BBS5, BBS8, BBS9 (highly integrated)
- **Central scaffold**: BBS9 wraps around multiple subunits (BBS1, BBS4)
- **Central core**: BBS4-BBS8 TPR interaction
- **Peripheral**: BBS5 PH domains bind BBS9 and BBS8

### Comparison with Other Studies
- **Previous crystal structures**: Limited to individual domains (BBS4-BBS8 C-terminal domains)
- **This study**: First complete BBSome structure
- **Novel findings**:
  - Complete architecture (head + body)
  - ARL6 activation mechanism
  - BBS1 swiveling required for activation
  - BBS9 as central scaffold

## Verbatim Text from Web Sources

### Overall Architecture
> "The eight subunits of the BBSome are arranged in two lobes called the head and the body, with the head formed by an asymmetric heterodimer of BBS2 and BBS7, and the other six subunits forming the body."

### Neck Formation
> "The coiled-coils of BBS2 and BBS9 come together to form the neck of the BBSome, and the coiled-coil of BBS7 is unpaired but contacts the midpoint of the neck."

### BBS4-BBS8 Core
> "BBS4 and BBS8 are related proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that fold into α-solenoids; BBS8 occupies a central region of the body whereas BBS4 runs along the side, and the two subunits are physically connected with the C-terminus of BBS8 binding perpendicular to the midsection of BBS4."

### BBS9 Scaffold
> "BBS9 wraps around BBS4 and parts of BBS1, and engulfs the GAE domain of BBS1 with its C-terminal GAE, platform and α-helical domains."

### BBS1 Connections
> "BBS1 binds to the N-terminal end of the TPR superhelix formed by BBS4 via its N-terminal β-propeller domain, wraps around BBS4 and BBS8, and binds with its C-terminal GAE domain to the TPR domain of BBS8."

### BBS5 PH Domains
> "BBS5 is composed of two PH domains that both interact with the β-propeller of BBS9, and one of the PH domains also interacts with BBS8."

### ARL6 Binding Site
> "ARL6 recognizes a composite binding site formed by BBS1 and BBS7 that is occluded in the inactive state. The interaction has been mapped to the N-terminal β-propeller domain of BBS1 (BBS1βprop), with ARL6 binding blades 1 and 7 of BBS1βprop."

### Activation Mechanism
> "Activation requires an unexpected swiveling of the β-propeller domain of BBS1, which widens a central cavity of the BBSome. Rotation of BBS1βprop in the ARL6-bound state breaks the interaction with BBS2βprop and opens a central cavity in the BBSome."

> "A loop of BBS7 that is disordered in the BBSome-only state forms a β-addition with the central β-sheet of ARL6."

## Notes

1. **Species consideration**: Paper uses bovine BBSome, but all interactions mapped to human orthologs for database
2. **BBS18/BBIP1**: Not resolved in these structures (may be peripheral or substoichiometric)
3. **Resolution quality**: 3.1 Å and 3.5 Å are excellent for cryo-EM, allowing detailed interface analysis
4. **Functional relevance**: Structures capture both inactive and ARL6-activated states
5. **Clinical relevance**: Mutations in BBS genes cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome (ciliopathy)
